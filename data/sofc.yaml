description: |-
  This is a an example input file that defines models for phases and
  interfaces that could be used, for example, to simulate a solid
  oxide fuel cell. Note, however, that reaction rate coefficients and
  species thermochemistry ARE NOT REAL VALUES - they are chosen only
  for the purposes of this example.

  Defines bulk (i.e., 3D) phases - a gas, a metal, and an oxide.
  The gas contains only the minimum number of species needed to model
  operation on hydrogen. The species definitions are imported from
  gri30.yaml. The initial composition is set to hydrogen + 5% water, but
  usually this is reset in the program importing this definition.

  The 'metal' phase will be used for the electrodes. All we need is
  a source/sink for electrons, so we define this phase as only
  containing electrons. Note that the 'metal' entry type requires
  specifying a density, but it is not used in this simulation and
  therefore is arbitrary.

  The electron is set to have zero enthalpy and entropy. Therefore,
  the chemical potential of the electron is zero, and the
  electrochemical potential is simply -F * phi, where phi is the
  electric potential of the metal. Note that this simple model is
  adequate only because all we require is a reservoir for electrons;
  if we wanted to do anything more complex, like carry out energy or
  charge balances on the metal, then we would require a more complex
  model. Note that there is no work function for this metal.

  Note: the "const_cp" species thermo model is used throughout this
  file (with the exception of the gaseous species, which use NASA
  polynomials imported from gri30.cti). The const_cp model assumes a
  constant specific heat, which by default is zero. Parameters that
  can be specified are cp0, t0, h0, and s0. If omitted, t0 = 300 K, h0
  = 0, and s0 = 0. The thermo properties are computed as follows: h =
  h0 + cp0*(t - t0), s = s0 + cp0*ln(t/t0). For work at a single
  temperature, it is sufficient to specify only h0.

  The 'oxide_bulk' phase is a very simple model for the bulk phase. We only
  consider the oxygen sublattice. The only species we define are a
  lattice oxygen, and an oxygen vacancy. Again, the density is a
  required input, but is not used here, so may be set arbitrarily.

  The vacancy will be modeled as truly vacant - it contains no atoms,
  has no charge, and has zero enthalpy and entropy.  This is different
  from the usual convention in which the vacancy properties are are
  expressed relative to the perfect crystal lattice. For example, in
  the usual convention, an oxygen vacancy has charge +2. But the
  convention we will use is that an oxygen ion has charge -2, and a
  vacancy has charge 0. It all works out the same, as long as we are
  consistent.

  The surface of a bulk phase must be treated like a separate phase, with its
  own set of species. In the 'metal_surface' phase we define the model for the
  metal surface.

  We allow the following species:
  (m)    - an empty metal site
  H(m)   - a chemisorbed H atom
  O(m)   - a chemisorbed O atom
  OH(m)  - a chemisorbed hydroxl
  H2O(m) - a physisorbed water molecule

  Notes:
  1. The site density is in mol/cm2, since no units are specified and
  'mol' and 'cm' were specified in the units directive below as the
  units for quantity and length, respectively.
  2. The 'reactions' field specifies that all reaction entries in this file
  that have are in the 'metal_surface-reactions' field are reactions belonging
  to this surface mechanism.

  On the oxide surface, we consider four species:
      1. (ox)     - a surface vacancy
      2. O''(ox)  - a surface oxygen with charge -2
      3. OH'(ox)  - a surface hydroxyl with charge -1
      4. H2O(ox)  - physisorbed neutral water

  The 'tpb' phase is th etriple phase boundary between the metal, oxide, and gas. A
  single species is specified, but it is not used, since all reactions
  only involve species on either side of the tpb. Note that the site
  density is in mol/cm. But since no reactions involve TPB species,
  this parameter is unused.
