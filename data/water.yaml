description: |-
  These two phases represent pure, condensed phases of water. They are
  modeled as being incompressible. Note that the liquid water phase
  defined here is very different from the phase "water" in
  liquidvapor.yaml, which uses an accurate liquid/vapor equation of
  state. That one, however, cannot be used as a part of a multi-phase
  mixture, while this one can.
