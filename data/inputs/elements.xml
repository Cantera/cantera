  <!--  Values are used from CIAAW. Atomic weights of the elements 2017
 when a single value is given. Available online at
 http://www.ciaaw.org/atomic-weights.htm

 When a range of values is given in the CIAAW table, the "conventional
 atomic weight" from the IUPAC Periodic Table is used. Available
 online at https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-01Dec18.pdf

 Values for deuterium and tritium are from: M. Wang et al. The AME2016 atomic
 mass evaluation. Chinese Physics C. doi:10.1088/1674-1137/41/3/030003.

 The electron mass is the 2018 CODATA value.

 If no value is given in either source, it is because no stable isotopes of
 that element are known. Therefore, that element is not included in this file.
