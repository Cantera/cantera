\section cxxsimpledemo A Very Simple C++ Program

A short C++ program that uses %Cantera is shown below. This program
reads in a specification of a gas mixture from an input file, and then
builds a new object representing the mixture. It then sets the
thermodynamic state and composition of the gas mixture, and prints out
a summary of its properties.

\include demo1a.cpp

This program produces the output below:

\endverbatim

As C++ programs go, this one is \e very short. It is the %Cantera
equivalent of the "Hello, World" program most programming textbooks
begin with. But it illustrates some important points in writing
%Cantera C++ programs.

- <b>The Cantera.h header</b>\n
Note that the program begins with 
\code
#include <cantera/Cantera.h>
\endcode
All %Cantera application programs must begin by including this header
file. The syntax of the include statement shown here is recommended,
since usually the %Cantera header files are installed within a
subdirectory named "cantera" in a directory on the search path
used by the compiler. If you need to include additional %Cantera headers, 
always include Cantera.h first. 
\see \ref cxx-headers

- <b>Catching CanteraError exceptions</b>\n
The entire body of the program is put inside a function that is invoked
within a \c try block in the main program. In this way, exceptions
thrown in the function or in any procedure it calls may be caught. In
this program, a \c catch block is defined for exceptions of type
CanteraError. The %Cantera kernel throws exceptions of this type, so it
is always a good idea to catch them. In the \c catch block, function
\c showErrors() may be called to print the error message associated
with the exception.
\see \ref cxx-exceptions

- <b>The 'report' function</b> The report function generates a
nicely-formatted report of the properties of a phase, including its
composition in both mole (X) and mass (Y) units. For each species
present, the non-dimensional chemical potential is also printed. This
is handy particularly when doing equilibrium calculations. This
function is very useful to see at a glance the state of some phase.
