Depends: python, python-numpy, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Common files needed for all Cantera interfaces
 Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for solving problems
 involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.
 Cantera can be used for simulating time-dependent or steady reactor
 networks and one-dimensional reacting flows. Thermodynamic models for
 ideal gases, aqueeous electrolytes, plasmas, and multiphase substances
 are provided.
 .
 This package includes programs for parsing and converting chemical
 mechanisms, a set of common mechanism files, and several sample problems.
