Description: Chemical kinetics, thermodynamics and transport properties
 Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems
 involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.
 Cantera can be used for simulating time-dependent or steady reactor
 networks and one-dimensional reacting flows. Thermodynamic models for
 ideal gases, aqueeous electrolytes, plasmas, and multiphase substances
 are provided.
