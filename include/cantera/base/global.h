 * @defgroup inputfiles Input File Handling
 *
 * The properties of phases and interfaces are specified in text files. These
 * procedures handle various aspects of reading these files.
 *
 * For input files not specified by an absolute pathname, %Cantera searches
 * for input files along a path that includes platform-specific default
 * locations, and possibly user-specified locations.
 *
 * The current directory (".") is always searched first. Then, on Windows
 * platforms, if environment variable COMMONPROGRAMFILES is set (which it
 * should be on Win XP or Win 2000), then directories under this one will be
 * added to the search path. The %Cantera Windows installer installs data
 * files to this location.
 *
 * On the Mac, directory '/Applications/Cantera/data' is added to the
 * search path.
 *
 * On any platform, if environment variable CANTERA_DATA is set to a
 * directory name, then this directory is added to the search path.
 *
 * Finally, the location where the data files were installed when
 * %Cantera was built is added to the search path.
 *
 * Additional directories may be added by calling function addDirectory.
 *
 * There are two different types of input files within %Cantera:
 *  - ctml: This is an xml file laid out in such a way that %Cantera can
 *          interpret the contents.
 *  - cti:  A human-readable ascii format for information that %Cantera
 *          will read.
 *
 * %Cantera can take its input from both types of files. However, given a file
 * in cti format, the initial operation that %Cantera will perform is to
 * translate the cti file into a ctml file. The translation is carried out via
 * a system call to a python interpreter program that actually carries out the
 * translation. In general, a new ctml file is created by the translation that
 * is written to the current local directory. The ctml file is then read back
 * into %Cantera as the input.
 *
 * Other input routines in other modules:
 *   @see importKinetics()
