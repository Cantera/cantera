 * Class to compute the increase in diffusive path length associated with
 * tortuous path diffusion through, for example, porous media.
 * This base class implementation relates tortuosity to volume fraction

 * exponent is referred to as the Bruggeman exponent.
 *
 * Note that the total diffusional flux is generally written as

 * \f]

 * \f$ C_T \f$, the total concentration, \f$ D_i \f$, the diffusion
 * coefficient, and \f$ X_i \f$, the mole fraction with Fickian
 * transport assumed.)
