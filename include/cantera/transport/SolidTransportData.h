//! Class SolidTransportData holds transport parameters for a specific solid-
//! phase species.
/*!
 * A SolidTransportData object is created for a solid phase
 * (not for each species as happens for the analogous LiquidTransportData).
 *
 * This class is mainly used to collect transport properties from the parse
 * phase in the TranportFactory and transfer them to the Transport class.
 * Transport properties are expressed by subclasses of LTPspecies. Note that we
 * use the liquid phase species model for the solid phases. That is, for the
 * time being at least, we ignore mixing models for solid phases and just
 * specify a transport property at the level that we specify the transport
 * property for a species in the liquid phase. One may need to be careful about
 * deleting pointers to LTPspecies objects created in the TransportFactory.
 *
 * All of the pointers in this class are shallow pointers. Therefore, this is
 * a passthrough class, which keeps track of pointer ownership by zeroing
 * pointers as we go. Yes, Yes, yes, this is not good.
