//! Class SimpleTransport implements mixture-averaged transport
//! properties for liquid phases.
/*!
 *  The model is based on that described by Newman, Electrochemical Systems
 *
 *  The velocity of species i may be described by the
 *  following equation p. 297 (12.1)
 *
 *   \f[
 *     c_i \nabla \mu_i = R T \sum_j \frac{c_i c_j}{c_T D_{ij}}
 *         (\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_i)
 *   \f]
 *
 * This as written is degenerate by 1 dof.
 *
 * To fix this we must add in the definition of the mass averaged
 * velocity of the solution. We will call the simple bold-faced
 *  \f$\mathbf{v} \f$
 * symbol the mass-averaged velocity. Then, the relation
 * between \f$\mathbf{v}\f$ and the individual species velocities is
 * \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$
 *
 *  \f[
 *      \rho_i \mathbf{v}_i =  \rho_i \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_i
 *  \f]
 *   where \f$\mathbf{j}_i\f$ are the diffusional fluxes of species i
 *   with respect to the mass averaged velocity and
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \sum_i \mathbf{j}_i = 0
 *  \f]
 *
 *  and
 *
 *  \f[
 *     \sum_i \rho_i \mathbf{v}_i =  \rho \mathbf{v}
 *  \f]
 *
 * Using these definitions, we can write
 *
 *  \f[
 *      \mathbf{v}_i =  \mathbf{v} + \frac{\mathbf{j}_i}{\rho_i}
 *  \f]
 *
 *  \f[
 *     c_i \nabla \mu_i = R T \sum_j \frac{c_i c_j}{c_T D_{ij}}
 *         (\frac{\mathbf{j}_j}{\rho_j} - \frac{\mathbf{j}_i}{\rho_i})
 *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
 *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
 *  \f]
 *
 * The equations that we actually solve are
 *
 *  \f[
 *     c_i \nabla \mu_i =
 *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
 *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
 *  \f]
 *  and we replace the 0th equation with the following:
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \sum_i \mathbf{j}_i = 0
 *  \f]
 *
 *  When there are charged species, we replace the rhs with the
 *  gradient of the electrochemical potential to obtain the
 *  modified equation
 *
 *  \f[
 *     c_i \nabla \mu_i + c_i F z_i \nabla \Phi
 *         =  R T \sum_j \frac{1}{D_{ij}}
 *         (\frac{x_i \mathbf{j}_j}{M_j} - \frac{x_j \mathbf{j}_i}{M_i})
 *  \f]
 *
 * With this formulation we may solve for the diffusion velocities,
 * without having to worry about what the mass averaged velocity
 * is.
 *
 *  <H2> Viscosity Calculation  </H2>
 *
 *  The viscosity calculation may be broken down into two parts.
 *  In the first part, the viscosity of the pure species are calculated
 *  In the second part, a mixing rule is applied. There are two mixing rules.
 *  Solvent-only and mixture-averaged.
 *
 *  For the solvent-only mixing rule, we use the pure species viscosity calculated for
 *  the solvent as the viscosity of the entire mixture. For the mixture averaged rule
 *  we do a mole fraction based average of the pure species viscosities:
 *
 *  Solvent-only:
 *    \f[
 *         \mu = \mu_0
 *    \f]
 *  Mixture-average:
 *    \f[
 *         \mu = \sum_k {\mu_k X_k}
 *    \f]
 *
 *  <H2> Calculate of the Binary Diffusion Coefficients </H2>
 *
 *  The binary diffusion coefficients are obtained from the pure species diffusion coefficients
 *  using an additive process
 *
 *    \f[
 *        D_{i,j} = \frac{1}{2} \left( D^0_i(T) +  D^0_j(T) \right)
 *    \f]
 *
 *  <H2> Electrical Mobilities </H2>
 *
 *   The mobility \f$  \mu^e_k \f$  is calculated from the diffusion coefficient using the Einstein relation.
 *
 *     \f[
 *          \mu^e_k = \frac{F D_k}{R T}
 *     \f]
 *
 *   The diffusion coefficients,  \f$  D_k \f$ , is calculated from a call to the mixture diffusion
 *   coefficient routine.
 *
 *  <H2> Species Diffusive Fluxes </H2>
 *
 *  The diffusive mass flux of species \e k is computed from the following
 *  formula
 *
 *  Usually the specified solution average velocity is the mass averaged velocity.
 *  This is changed in some subclasses, however.
 *
 *    \f[
 *         j_k = - c^T M_k D_k \nabla X_k - \rho Y_k V_c
 *    \f]
 *
 *    where V_c is the correction velocity
 *
 *    \f[
 *         \rho V_c =  - \sum_j {c^T M_j D_j \nabla X_j}
 *    \f]
 *
 *  In the above equation, \f$ D_k \f$ is the mixture diffusivity for species k calculated for the current
 *  conditions, which may depend on T, P, and X_k. \f$ C^T \f$ is the total concentration of the phase.
 *
 *  When this is electrical migration, the formulas above are enhanced to
 *
 *    \f[
 *         j_k = - C^T M_k D_k \nabla X_k  + F C^T M_k \frac{D_k}{ R T } X_k z_k   \nabla V   - \rho Y_k V_c
 *    \f]
 *
 *   where V_c is the correction velocity
 *
 *    \f[
 *         \rho V_c =  - \sum_j {c^T M_j D_j \nabla X_j} + \sum_j  F C^T M_j \frac{D_j}{ R T } X_j z_j  \nabla V
 *    \f]
 *
 *  <H2> Species Diffusional Velocities </H2>
 *
 *  Species diffusional velocities are calculated from the species diffusional fluxes, within this object,
 *  using the following formula for the diffusional velocity of the kth species, \f$  V_k^d \f$
 *
 *     \f[
 *         j_k = \rho Y_k V_k^d
 *     \f]
 *
 *         TODO
 *   This object has to be made compatible with different types of reference velocities. Right now, elements
 *   of the formulas are only compatible with the mass-averaged velocity.
