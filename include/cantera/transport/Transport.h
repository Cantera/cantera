//! Base class for transport property managers.
/*!
 * All classes that compute transport properties for a single phase derive from
 * this class.  Class Transport is meant to be used as a base class only. It is
 * possible to instantiate it, but its methods throw exceptions if called.
 *
 * ## Relationship of the Transport class to the ThermoPhase Class
 *
 * This section describes how calculations are carried out within the Transport
 * class. The Transport class and derived classes of the the Transport class
 * necessarily use the ThermoPhase class to obtain the list of species and the
 * thermodynamic state of the phase.
 *
 * No state information is stored within Transport classes. Queries to the
 * underlying ThermoPhase object must be made to obtain the state of the system.
 *
 * An exception to this however is the state information concerning the the
 * gradients of variables. This information is not stored within the ThermoPhase
 * objects. It may be collected within the Transport objects. In fact, the
 * meaning of const operations within the Transport class refers to calculations
 * which do not change the state of the system nor the state of the first order
 * gradients of the system.
 *
 * When a const operation is evoked within the Transport class, it is also
 * implicitly assumed that the underlying state within the ThermoPhase object
 * has not changed its values.
 *
 * @todo Provide a general mechanism to store the gradients of state variables
 *        within the system.
