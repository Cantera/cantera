//! Class LiquidTransport implements models for transport
//! properties for liquid phases.
/*!
 *  Liquid Transport is set up with some flexibility in this class.  Transport
 *  properties like viscosity and thermal conductivity are allowed flexibility
 *  within the constraints of the LiquidTransportProperty and
 *  LiquidTransportInteractions classes. For species diffusion, the
 *  LiquidTransport class focuses on the Stefan-Maxwell equation to determine
 *  the diffusion velocities.  Other options for liquid diffusion include
 *  solvent-dominated diffusion, and a class SolventTransport should be
 *  forthcoming.
 *
 *  The class LiquidTransport has several roles.
 *  -# It brings together the individual species transport
 *     properties, expressed as subclasses of LTPspecies
 *     (Liquid Transport Properties of Species) through
 *     LiquidTransportData, with models for
 *     the composition dependence of liquid transport properties
 *     expressed as subclasses of LiquidTranInteraction
 *     (mixing rules) through LiquidTransportParams.  Calculating
 *     mixture properties generally consists of calling the
 *     getMixTansProp member of LiquidTranInteraction by passing
 *     a vector of LTPSpecies
 *  -# It calculates the bulk velocity \f$ \vec{v} \f$ and
 *     individual species diffusion velocities, \f$ \vec{V_i} \f$
 *     using the Stefan-Maxwell equations.  It is possible to set a
 *     flag to calculate relative to a mass-averaged bulk velocity,
 *     relative to a mole-averaged bulk velocity or relative to a
 *     single species velocity using the \<velocityBasis basis="mass"\>,
 *     \<velocityBasis basis="mass"\>, or \<velocityBasis basis="Cl-"\>
 *     keyword. Mass-averaged velocities are the default for which
 *     the diffusion velocities satisfy
 *     \f[
 *        \sum_{i} Y_i \vec{V_i} = 0
 *     \f]
 *     for mass fraction \f$ Y_i \f$.  For mole-averaged velocities
 *     \f[
 *        \sum_{i} X_i \vec{V_i} = 0
 *     \f]
 *     for mole fraction \f$ X_i \f$. or
 *     \f[
 *        \vec{V_i} = 0
 *     \f]
 *     for reference species \f$ i \f$.
 *  -# It provides access to a number of derived quantities
 *     related to transport properties as described in the
 *     various methods below.
 *
 *  Within LiquidTransport, the state is presumed to be
 *  defined in terms of the  species mole fraction,
 *  temperature and pressure.  Charged species are expected
 *  and quantities like the electric current are computed
 *  based on a combined electrochemcial potential.
