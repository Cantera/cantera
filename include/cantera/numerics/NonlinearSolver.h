/*!
 *  This is a small nonlinear solver that can solve highly nonlinear problems that
 *  must use a dense matrix to relax the system.
 *
 *  Newton's method is used.
 *
 *  Damping is used extensively when relaxing the system.
 *
 *   The basic idea is that we predict a direction that is parameterized by an overall coordinate
 *   value, beta, from zero to one, This may or may not be the same as the value, damp,
 *   depending upon whether the direction is straight.
 *
 * TIME STEP TYPE
 *
 *   The code solves a nonlinear problem. Frequently the nonlinear problem is created from time-dependent
 *   residual. Whenever you change the solution vector, you are also changing the derivative of the
 *   solution vector. Therefore, the code has the option of altering ydot, a vector of time derivatives
 *   of the solution in tandem with the solution vector and then feeding a residual and Jacobian routine
 *   with the time derivatives as well as the solution. The code has support for a backwards euler method
 *   and a second order  Adams-Bashforth or Trapezoidal Rule.
 *
 *   In order to use these methods, the solver must be initialized with delta_t and m_y_nm1[i] to specify
 *   the conditions at the previous time step. For second order methods, the time derivative at t_nm1 must
 *   also be supplied,  m_ydot_nm1[i]. Then the solution type  NSOLN_TYPE_TIME_DEPENDENT may be used to
 *   solve the problem.
 *
 *   For steady state problem whose residual doesn't have a solution time derivative in it, you should
 *   use the NSOLN_TYPE_STEADY_STATE problem type.
 *
 *   We have a NSOLN_TYPE_PSEUDO_TIME_DEPENDENT defined. However, this is not implemented yet. This would
 *   be a pseudo time dependent calculation, where an optional time derivative could be added in order to
 *   help equilibrate a nonlinear steady state system. The time transient is not important in and of
 *   itself. Many physical systems have a time dependence to them that provides a natural way to relax
 *   the nonlinear system.
