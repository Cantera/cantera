/*!
 *   The root finder solves a single nonlinear equation described below.
 *
 *     \f[
 *          f(x) = f_0
 *     \f]
 *
 *   \f$ f(x) \f$ is assumed to be single valued as a function of x.\f$ f(x) \f$ is not assumed to be continuous nor is
 *   its derivative assumed to be well formed.
 *
 *   Root finders are significantly different in the sense that do not have to rely
 *   solely on Newton's method to find the answer to the problem. Instead they use a method to bound
 *   the solution between high and low values and then use a method to refine that bound.  The eventual
 *   solution to the problem is presented as x_best and as a bound, delta_X, on the solution
 *   component.  Because of this, they are far more stable for functions and Jacobians that have discontinuities
 *   or noise associated with them.
 *
 *   The algorithm is a convolution of a local Secant method with an approach of finding a straddle in x.
 *   The Jacobian is never required.
 *
 *   There is a general breakdown of the algorithm into stages. The first stage seeks to find a straddle of the
 *   function. The second stage seeks to reduce the bounds in x and f in order to satisfy the specification of the
 *   stopping criteria. In the last stage the algorithm seeks to find the base value of x that satisfies the
 *   original equation given what it current knows about the function.
