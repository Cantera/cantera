/*!
 * Multiphase chemical equilibrium solver.  Class MultiPhaseEquil is designed
 * to be used to set a mixture containing one or more phases to a state of
 * chemical equilibrium.  It implements the VCS algorithm, described in Smith
 * and Missen, "Chemical Reaction Equilibrium."
 *
 * This class only handles chemical equilibrium at a specified temperature and
 * pressure. To compute equilibrium holding other properties fixed, it is
 * necessary to iterate on T and P in an "outer" loop, until the specified
 * properties have the desired values. This is done, for example, in method
 * equilibrate of class MultiPhase.
 *
 * This class is primarily meant to be used internally by the equilibrate
 * method of class MultiPhase, although there is no reason it cannot be used
 * directly in application programs if desired.
