//!  Phase information and Phase calculations for vcs.
/*!
 *  Each phase in a vcs calculation has a vcs_VolPhase object associated
 *  with it. This object helps to coordinate property evaluations for
 *  species within the phase. Usually these evaluations must be carried
 *  out on a per phase basis. However, vcs frequently needs per species
 *  quantities. Therefore, we need an interface layer between vcs
 *  and Cantera's ThermoPhase.
 *
 *  The species stay in the same ordering within this structure.
 *  The vcs algorithm will change the ordering of species in
 *  the global species list. However, the indexing of species in this
 *  list stays the same. This structure contains structures that
 *  point to the species belonging to this phase in the global
 *  vcs species list.
 *
 * This object is considered not to own the underlying Cantera ThermoPhase
 * object for the phase.
 *
 * This object contains an idea of the temperature and pressure.
 * It checks to see if if the temperature and pressure has changed before calling
 * underlying property evaluation routines.
 *
 * The object contains values for the electric potential of a phase.
 * It coordinates the evaluation of properties wrt when the electric
 * potential of a phase has changed.
 *
 * The object knows about the mole fractions of the phase. It controls
 * the values of mole fractions, and coordinates the property evaluation
 * wrt to changes in the mole fractions. It also will keep track of the
 * likely values of mole fractions in multicomponent phases even when
 * the phase doesn't actually exist within the thermo program.
 *
 * The object knows about the total moles of a phase. It checks to
 * see if the phase currently exists or not, and modifies its behavior
 * accordingly.
 *
 * Activity coefficients and volume calculations are lagged. They are only
 * called when they are needed (and when the state has changed so that they
 * need to be recalculated).
