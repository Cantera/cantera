     *  Handling of Small Species:
     * ------------------------------
     * As per the discussion above, for small species where the mole fraction
     *
     *     z(i) < VCS_DELETE_MINORSPECIES_CUTOFF
     *
     * The chemical potential is calculated as:
     *

     *
     * Species in the following categories are treated as "small species"
     *   - #VCS_SPECIES_DELETED
     *   - #VCS_SPECIES_ACTIVEBUTZERO
     *
     * For species in multispecies phases which are currently not active, the
     * treatment is different. These species are in the following species
     * categories:
     *   - #VCS_SPECIES_ZEROEDMS
     *   - #VCS_SPECIES_ZEROEDPHASE
     *
     * For these species, the `ln( ActCoeff[I] X[I])` term is dropped
     * altogether. The following equation is used:
     *
     *     m_feSpecies(I) = m_SSfeSpecies(I)
     *                    + Charge[I] * Faraday_dim * phasePhi[iphase];

     * Handling of "Species" Representing Interfacial Voltages
     * ---------------------------------------------------------

     * following formula
     *
     *     m_feSpecies(I) = m_SSfeSpecies(I) - F z[I] / RT
     *
     * - `F` is Faraday's constant.
     * - `R` = gas constant
     * - `T` = temperature
     * - `V` = potential of the interface = phi_electrode - phi_solution
     *
     * For these species, the solution vector unknown, z[I], is V, the phase
     * voltage, in volts.

     * @param ll     Determine which group of species gets updated
     *     - `ll = 0`: Calculate for all species
     *     - `ll < 0`: calculate for components and for major non-components
