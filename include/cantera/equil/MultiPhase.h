//! A class for multiphase mixtures. The mixture can contain any

/*!
 * This object is the basic tool used by Cantera for use in Multiphase
 * equilibrium calculations.
 *
 * It is a container for a set of phases. Each phase has a given number of
 * kmoles. Therefore, MultiPhase may be considered an "extrinsic"
 * thermodynamic object, in contrast to the ThermoPhase object, which is an
 * "intrinsic" thermodynamic object.
 *
 * MultiPhase may be considered to be "upstream" of the ThermoPhase objects in
 * the sense that setting a property within MultiPhase, such as temperature,
 * pressure, or species mole number, affects the underlying ThermoPhase
 * object, but not the other way around.
 *
 * All phases have the same temperature and pressure, and a specified number
 * of moles for each phase. The phases do not need to have the same elements.
 * For example, a mixture might consist of a gaseous phase with elements (H,
 * C, O, N), a solid carbon phase containing only element C, etc. A master
 * element set will be constructed for the mixture that is the intersection of
 * the elements of each phase.
 *
 * Below, reference is made to global species and global elements. These refer
 * to the collective species and elements encompassing all of the phases
 * tracked by the object.
 *
 * The global element list kept by this object is an intersection of the
 * element lists of all the phases that comprise the MultiPhase.
 *
 * The global species list kept by this object is a concatenated list of all
 * of the species in all the phases that comprise the MultiPhase. The ordering
 * of species is contiguous with respect to the phase id.

     * This method is designed for use in computing chemical equilibrium by
     * Gibbs minimization. For solution phases (more than one species), this

     * 0 C, the fits for H2O(L) are only done from 0 C to 100 C, etc. Using

     * result in spurious chemical potentials, and can lead to condensed
     * phases appearing when in fact they should be absent.
     *
     * By setting \a not_mu to a large positive value, it is possible to force

//! Handles the potential rearrangement of the constraint equations

/*!
 * Rearrangement is only necessary when the number of components is less
 * than the number of elements. For this case, some constraints can never
 * be satisfied exactly, because the range space represented by the Formula
 * Matrix of the components can't span the extra space. These constraints,
 * which are out of the range space of the component Formula matrix
 * entries, are migrated to the back of the Formula matrix.
 *
 * A prototypical example is an extra element column in FormulaMatrix[], which
 * is identically zero. For example, let's say that argon is has an element
 * column in FormulaMatrix[], but no species in the mechanism actually
 * contains argon. Then, nc < ne. Unless the entry for desired element
 * abundance vector for Ar is zero, then this element abundance constraint can
 * never be satisfied. The constraint vector is not in the range space of the
 * formula matrix.
 *
 * Also, without perturbation of FormulaMatrix[], BasisOptimize[] would
 * produce a zero pivot because the matrix would be singular (unless the argon
 * element column was already the last column of  FormulaMatrix[].
 *
 * This routine borrows heavily from BasisOptimize algorithm. It finds nc
 * constraints which span the range space of the Component Formula matrix, and
 * assigns them as the first nc components in the formula matrix. This
 * guarantees that BasisOptimize has a nonsingular matrix to invert.
