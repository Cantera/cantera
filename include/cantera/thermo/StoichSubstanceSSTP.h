//!  Class %StoichSubstanceSSTP represents a stoichiometric (fixed
//!   composition)  incompressible substance.
/*!
 * This class internally changes the independent degree of freedom from
 * density to pressure. This is necessary because the phase is
 * incompressible. It uses a constant volume approximation.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Species Standard %State Properties </b>
 *
 *  This class inherits from SingleSpeciesTP.
 *  It is assumed that the reference state thermodynamics may be
 *  obtained by a pointer to a populated species thermodynamic property
 *  manager class (see ThermoPhase::m_spthermo). How to relate pressure
 *  changes to the reference state thermodynamics is resolved at this level.
 *
 *  For an incompressible,
 * stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties
 * are specified by giving the standard-state enthalpy, the
 * term \f$ P_0 \hat v\f$ is subtracted from the specified molar
 * enthalpy to compute the molar internal energy. The entropy is
 * assumed to be independent of the pressure.
 *
 * The enthalpy function is given by the following relation.
 *
 *       \f[
 *              h^o_k(T,P) =
 *                  h^{ref}_k(T) + \tilde v \left( P - P_{ref} \right)
 *       \f]
 *
 * For an incompressible,
 * stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties
 * are specified by giving the standard-state enthalpy, the
 * term \f$ P_{ref} \tilde v\f$ is subtracted from the specified reference molar
 * enthalpy to compute the molar internal energy.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            u^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T) - P_{ref} \tilde v
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard state heat capacity and entropy are independent
 * of pressure. The standard state gibbs free energy is obtained
 * from the enthalpy and entropy functions.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties </b>
 *
 *  All solution properties are obtained from the standard state
 *  species functions, since there is only one species in the phase.
 *
 * <b> Application within %Kinetics Managers </b>
 *
 * The standard concentration is equal to 1.0. This means that the
 * kinetics operator works on an (activities basis). Since this
 * is a stoichiometric substance, this means that the concentration
 * of this phase drops out of kinetics expressions.
 *
 * An example of a reaction using this is a sticking coefficient
 * reaction of a substance in an ideal gas phase on a surface with a bulk phase
 * species in this phase. In this case, the rate of progress for this
 * reaction, \f$ R_s \f$, may be expressed via the following equation:
 *   \f[
 *    R_s = k_s C_{gas}
 *   \f]
 * where the units for \f$ R_s \f$ are kmol m-2 s-1. \f$ C_{gas} \f$ has units
 * of kmol m-3. Therefore, the kinetic rate constant,  \f$ k_s \f$, has
 * units of m s-1. Nowhere does the concentration of the bulk phase
 * appear in the rate constant expression, since it's a stoichiometric
 * phase and the activity is always equal to 1.0.
 *
 * <b> Instantiation of the Class </b>
 *
 * The constructor for this phase is NOT located in the default ThermoFactory
 * for %Cantera. However, a new %StoichSubstanceSSTP may be created by
 * the following code snippets:
 *
 * @code
 *    sprintf(file_ID,"%s#NaCl(S)", iFile);
 *    XML_Node *xm = get_XML_NameID("phase", file_ID, 0);
 *    StoichSubstanceSSTP *solid = new StoichSubstanceSSTP(*xm);
 * @endcode
 *
 * or by the following call to importPhase():
 *
 * @code
 *    sprintf(file_ID,"%s#NaCl(S)", iFile);
 *    XML_Node *xm = get_XML_NameID("phase", file_ID, 0);
 *    StoichSubstanceSSTP solid;
 *    importPhase(*xm, &solid);
 * @endcode
 *
 *   <b> XML Example </b>
 *
 * The phase model name for this is called StoichSubstance. It must be supplied
 * as the model attribute of the thermo XML element entry.
 * Within the phase XML block,
 * the density of the phase must be specified. An example of an XML file
 * this phase is given below.
