/*!
 * Class ThermoPhase is the base class for the family of classes
 * that represent phases of matter of any type. It defines a
 * common public interface, and implements a few methods. Most of
 * the methods, however, are declared virtual and are meant to be
 * overloaded in derived classes.  The standard way used
 * throughout Cantera to compute properties of phases of matter is
 * through pointers of type ThermoPhase* that point to objects of
 * subclasses of ThermoPhase.
 *
 * Class ThermoPhase extends class Phase by adding methods to compute
 * thermodynamic properties in addition to the ones (temperature, density,
 * composition) that class Phase provides. The distinction is that
 * the methods declared in ThermoPhase require knowing the
 * particular equation of state of the phase of interest, while
 * those of class Phase do not, since they only involve data values
 * stored within the object.
 *
 * Instances of subclasses of %ThermoPhase should be created using
 * the factory class ThermoFactory, not by calling the constructor
 * directly. This allows new classes to be used with the various
 * Cantera language interfaces.
 *
 * To implement a new equation of state, derive a class from
 * ThermoPhase and overload the virtual methods in
 * ThermoPhase. Methods that are not needed can be left
 * unimplemented, which will cause an exception to be thrown if it
 * is called.
 *
 * Relationship with the kinetics operator:
 *
 * Describe activity coefficients.
 *
 * Describe K_a, K_p, and K_c, These are three different equilibrium
 * constants.
 *
 *   K_a is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the
 *   standard state Gibbs free energy values. It is by definition
 *   dimensionless.
 *
 *   K_p is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the
 *   reference state gibbs free energy values. It is by definition
 *   dimensionless. The pressure dependence is handled entirely
 *   on the rhs of the equilibrium expression.
 *
 *   K_c is the equilibrium constant calculated from the
 *   activity concentrations. The dimensions depend on the number
 *   of products and reactants.
 *
 * The kinetics manager requires the calculation of K_c for the
 * calculation of the reverse rate constant
