/*!
 * Class ThermoPhase is the base class for the family of classes that represent
 * phases of matter of any type. It defines a common public interface, and
 * implements a few methods. Most of the methods, however, are declared virtual
 * and are meant to be overloaded in derived classes.  The standard way used
 * throughout Cantera to compute properties of phases of matter is through
 * pointers of type ThermoPhase* that point to objects of subclasses of
 * ThermoPhase.
 *
 * Class ThermoPhase extends class Phase by adding methods to compute
 * thermodynamic properties in addition to the ones that are used to define the
 * state of a substance (temperature, density/pressure and composition). The
 * distinction is that the methods declared in ThermoPhase require knowing the
 * particular equation of state of the phase of interest, while those of class
 * Phase do not, since they only involve data values stored within the object.
 *
 * Instances of subclasses of ThermoPhase should be created using the factory
 * class ThermoFactory, not by calling the constructor directly. This allows new
 * classes to be used with the various Cantera language interfaces.
 *
 * To implement a new equation of state, derive a class from ThermoPhase and
 * overload the virtual methods in ThermoPhase. Methods that are not needed can
 * be left unimplemented, which will cause an exception to be thrown if it is
 * called.
 *
 * Relationship with the kinetics operator:
 *
 * Describe activity coefficients.
 *
 * Describe K_a, K_p, and K_c, These are three different equilibrium
 * constants.
 *
 *   K_a is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the standard state
 *   Gibbs free energy values. It is by definition dimensionless.
 *
 *   K_p is the calculation of the equilibrium constant from the reference state
 *   Gibbs free energy values. It is by definition dimensionless. The pressure
 *   dependence is handled entirely on the RHS of the equilibrium expression.
 *
 *   K_c is the equilibrium constant calculated from the activity
 *   concentrations. The dimensions depend on the number of products and
 *   reactants.
 *
 * The kinetics manager requires the calculation of K_c for the calculation of
 * the reverse rate constant
