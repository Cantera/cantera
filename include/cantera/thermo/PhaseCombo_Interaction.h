//!  PhaseCombo_Interaction is a derived class of GibbsExcessVPSSTP that employs
//!  the Margules approximation for the excess gibbs free energy while eliminating
//!  the entropy of mixing term.
/*!
 *  PhaseCombo_Interaction derives from class GibbsExcessVPSSTP which is derived from VPStandardStateTP,
 *  and overloads the virtual methods defined there with ones that
 *  use expressions appropriate for the Margules Excess gibbs free energy approximation.
 *  The reader should refer to the MargulesVPSSTP class for information on that class.
 *  This class in addition adds a term to the activity coefficient that eliminates the
 *  ideal solution mixing term within the chemical potential. This is a very radical thing
 *  to do, but it is supported by experimental evidence under some conditions.
 *
 *  The independent unknowns are pressure, temperature, and mass fraction.
 *
 *  Several concepts are introduced. The first concept is that there are temporary
 *  variables for holding the species standard state values of Cp, H, S, G, and V at the
 *  last temperature and pressure called. These functions are not recalculated
 *  if a new call is made using the previous temperature and pressure. Currently,
 *  these variables and the calculation method are handled by the VPSSMgr class,
 *  for which VPStandardStateTP owns a pointer to.
 *
 *  To support the above functionality, pressure and temperature variables,
 *  m_plast_ss and m_tlast_ss, are kept which store the last pressure and temperature
 *  used in the evaluation of standard state properties.
 *
 *  This class is introduced to represent specific conditions observed in thermal batteries.
 *  HOwever, it may be physically motivated to represent conditions where there may
 *  be a mixture of compounds that are not "mixed" at the molecular level. Therefore, there
 *  is no mixing term.
 *
 *  The lack of a mixing term has profound effects. First, the mole fraction of a species
 *  can now be identically zero due to thermodynamic considerations. The phase behaves more
 *  like a series of phases. That's why we named it PhaseCombo.

 * <HR>
 * <H2> Specification of Species Standard %State Properties </H2>
 * <HR>
 *
 *  All species are defined to have standard states that depend upon both
 *  the temperature and the pressure. The Margules approximation assumes
 *  symmetric standard states, where all of the standard state assume
 *  that the species are in pure component states at the temperature
 *  and pressure of the solution.  I don't think it prevents, however,
 *  some species from being dilute in the solution.
 *
 * <HR>
 * <H2> Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties </H2>
 * <HR>
 *
 * The molar excess Gibbs free energy is given by the following formula which is a sum over interactions <I>i</I>.
 * Each of the interactions are binary interactions involving two of the species in the phase, denoted, <I>Ai</I>
 * and <I>Bi</I>.
 * This is the generalization of the Margules formulation for a phase
 * that has more than 2 species. The second term in the excess gibbs free energy is a negation of the
 *  ideal solution's mixing term.

 *      \f]
 *
 *  Taking the derivatives results in the following expression
 *
 *      \f[
 *           R T \ln( \gamma_k )= \sum_i \left( \left( \delta_{Ai,k} X_{Bi} + \delta_{Bi,k} X_{Ai}  - X_{Ai} X_{Bi} \right)
 *            \left( g^E_{o,i} +  g^E_{1,i} X_{Bi} \right) +
 *            \left( \delta_{Bi,k} - X_{Bi} \right)      X_{Ai} X_{Bi}  g^E_{1,i} \right) - RT \ln{X_k}
 *      \f]
 *
 *  where
 *        \f$  g^E_{o,i} =  h_{o,i} - T s_{o,i} \f$ and \f$ g^E_{1,i} =  h_{1,i} - T s_{1,i} \f$
 *  and where \f$ X_k \f$ is the mole fraction of species <I>k</I>.
 *
 *  This object inherits from the class VPStandardStateTP. Therefore, the specification and
 *  calculation of all standard state and reference state values are handled at that level. Various functional
 *  forms for the standard state are permissible.
 *  The chemical potential for species <I>k</I> is equal to
 *

 *
 *   \f$ C^a_k\f$ are defined such that \f$ a_k = C^a_k /
 *   C^s_k, \f$ where \f$ C^s_k \f$ is a standard concentration
 *   defined below and \f$ a_k \f$ are activities used in the
 *   thermodynamic functions.  These activity (or generalized) concentrations are used
 *   by kinetics manager classes to compute the forward and reverse rates of elementary reactions.
 *   The activity concentration,\f$  C^a_k \f$,is given by the following expression.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            C^a_k = C^s_k  X_k  = \frac{P}{R T} X_k
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard concentration for species <I>k</I> is independent of <I>k</I> and equal to
 *
 *        \f[
 *            C^s_k =  C^s = \frac{P}{R T}
 *        \f]
 *
 * For example, a bulk-phase binary gas reaction between species j and k, producing
 * a new gas species l would have the
 * following equation for its rate of progress variable, \f$ R^1 \f$, which has
 * units of kmol m-3 s-1.
 *
 *   \f[
 *    R^1 = k^1 C_j^a C_k^a =  k^1 (C^s a_j) (C^s a_k)
 *   \f]
 *
 *  where
 *
 *   \f[
 *      C_j^a = C^s a_j \mbox{\quad and \quad} C_k^a = C^s a_k
 *   \f]
 *
 *  \f$ C_j^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species j, and
 *  \f$ C_k^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species k. \f$ C^s \f$
 *  is the standard concentration. \f$ a_j \f$ is
 *  the activity of species j which is equal to the mole fraction of j.
 *
 *  The reverse rate constant can then be obtained from the law of microscopic reversibility
 *  and the equilibrium expression for the system.
 *
 *   \f[
 *         \frac{a_j a_k}{ a_l} = K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^o_l - \mu^o_j - \mu^o_k}{R T} )
 *   \f]
 *
 *  \f$  K_a^{o,1} \f$ is the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant, associated with
 *  the pressure dependent standard states \f$ \mu^o_l(T,P) \f$ and their associated activities,
 *  \f$ a_l \f$, repeated here:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu_l(T,P) = \mu^o_l(T, P) + R T \log(a_l)
 *       \f]
 *
 *  We can switch over to expressing the equilibrium constant in terms of the reference
 *  state chemical potentials
 *
 *   \f[
 *       K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{P}
 *   \f]
 *
 *   The concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$, may be obtained by changing over
 *   to activity concentrations. When this is done:
 *
 *   \f[
 *         \frac{C^a_j C^a_k}{ C^a_l} = C^o K_a^{o,1} = K_c^1 =
 *             \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{RT}
 *   \f]
 *
 *  %Kinetics managers will calculate the concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$,
 *  using the second and third part of the above expression as a definition for the concentration
 *  equilibrium constant.
 *
 *  For completeness, the pressure equilibrium constant may be obtained as well
 *
 *  \f[
 *         \frac{P_j P_k}{ P_l P_{ref}} = K_p^1 = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} )
 *  \f]
 *
 *  \f$ K_p \f$ is the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for ideal gases. However, it isn't
 *  necessarily the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for other types of phases; \f$ K_c \f$ is
 *  used instead because it is completely general.
 *
 *  The reverse rate of progress may be written down as
 *  \f[
 *    R^{-1} = k^{-1} C_l^a =  k^{-1} (C^o a_l)
 *  \f]
 *
 *  where we can use the concept of microscopic reversibility to
 *  write the reverse rate constant in terms of the
 *  forward reate constant and the concentration equilibrium
 *  constant, \f$ K_c \f$.
 *
 *    \f[
 *       k^{-1} =  k^1 K^1_c
 *    \f]
 *
 *  \f$k^{-1} \f$ has units of s-1.
