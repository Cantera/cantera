//!  A simple thermodynamic model for a surface phase,
//!  assuming an ideal solution model.
/*!
 * The surface consists of a grid of equivalent sites.
 * Surface species may be defined to
 * occupy one or more sites. The surface species are assumed to be
 * independent, and thus the species form an ideal solution.
 *
 * The density of surface sites is given by the variable \f$ n_0 \f$,
 * which has SI units of kmol m-2.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Species Standard State Properties </b>
 *
 *  It is assumed that the reference state thermodynamics may be
 *  obtained by a pointer to a populated species thermodynamic property
 *  manager class (see ThermoPhase::m_spthermo). How to relate pressure
 *  changes to the reference state thermodynamics is resolved at this level.
 *
 *  Pressure is defined as an independent variable in this phase. However, it has
 *  no effect on any quantities, as the molar concentration is a constant.
 *
 * Therefore, The standard state internal energy for species  <I>k</I> is
 * equal to the enthalpy for species <I>k</I>.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            u^o_k = h^o_k
 *       \f]
 *
 *   Also, the standard state chemical potentials, entropy, and heat capacities
 *   are independent of pressure. The standard state Gibbs free energy is obtained
 * from the enthalpy and entropy functions.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties </b>
 *
 * The activity of species defined in the phase is given by
 *       \f[
 *            a_k = \theta_k
 *       \f]
 *
 * The chemical potential for species <I>k</I> is equal to
 *       \f[
 *            \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^o_k(T) + R T \log(\theta_k)
 *       \f]
 *
 * Pressure is defined as an independent variable in this phase. However, it has
 * no effect on any quantities, as the molar concentration is a constant.
 *
 * The internal energy for species k is equal to the enthalpy for species <I>k</I>
 *       \f[
 *            u_k = h_k
 *       \f]
 *
 * The entropy for the phase is given by the following relation, which is
 * independent of the pressure:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            s_k(T,P) = s^o_k(T) - R \log(\theta_k)
 *       \f]
 *
 * <b> %Application within Kinetics Managers </b>
 *
 * The activity concentration,\f$  C^a_k \f$, used by the kinetics manager, is equal to
 * the actual concentration, \f$ C^s_k \f$, and is given by the following
 * expression.
 *       \f[
 *            C^a_k = C^s_k = \frac{\theta_k  n_0}{s_k}
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard concentration for species <I>k</I> is:
 *        \f[
 *            C^0_k = \frac{n_0}{s_k}
 *        \f]
 *
 * <b> Instantiation of the Class </b>
 *
 * The constructor for this phase is located in the default ThermoFactory
 * for %Cantera. A new SurfPhase may be created by the following code snippet:
 *
 * @code
 *    XML_Node *xc = get_XML_File("diamond.xml");
 *    XML_Node * const xs = xc->findNameID("phase", "diamond_100");
 *    ThermoPhase *diamond100TP_tp = newPhase(*xs);
 *    SurfPhase *diamond100TP = dynamic_cast <SurfPhase *>(diamond100TP_tp);
 * @endcode
 *
 * or by the following constructor:
 *
 * @code
 *    XML_Node *xc = get_XML_File("diamond.xml");
 *    XML_Node * const xs = xc->findNameID("phase", "diamond_100");
 *    SurfPhase *diamond100TP = new SurfPhase(*xs);
 * @endcode
 *
 *   <b> XML Example </b>
 *
 *   An example of an XML Element named phase setting up a SurfPhase object named diamond_100
 *   is given below.
 *
 * @code
 * <phase dim="2" id="diamond_100">
 *    <elementArray datasrc="elements.xml">H C</elementArray>
