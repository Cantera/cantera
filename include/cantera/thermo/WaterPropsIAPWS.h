 * Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and
 * Scientific Use," J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Dat, 31, 387, 2002.
 *
 * This class provides a very complicated polynomial for the specific
 * Helmholtz free energy of water, as a function of temperature and density.
 *
 * \f[
 *     \frac{M\hat{f}(\rho,T)}{R T} = \phi(\delta, \tau) =
 *                     \phi^o(\delta, \tau) +  \phi^r(\delta, \tau)
 * \f]
 *
 * where
 *
 * \f[
 *     \delta = \rho / \rho_c \quad \mathrm{and} \quad \tau = T_c / T
 * \f]
 *
 * The following constants are assumed
 *
 * \f[
 *     T_c = 647.096\mathrm{\;K}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *     \rho_c = 322 \mathrm{\;kg\,m^{-3}}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *     R/M = 0.46151805 \mathrm{\;kJ\,kg^{-1}\,K^{-1}}
 * \f]
 *
 * The free energy is a unique single-valued function of the temperature and
 * density over its entire range.
 *
 * Note, the base thermodynamic state for this class is the one used in the
 * steam tables, i.e., the liquid at the triple point for water has the
 * following properties:
 *
 *   - u(273.16, rho)    = 0.0
 *   - s(273.16, rho)    = 0.0
 *   - psat(273.16)      = 611.655 Pascal
 *   - rho(273.16, psat) = 999.793 kg m-3
 *
 * Therefore, to use this class within %Cantera, offsets to u() and s() must
 * be used to put the water class onto the same basis as other thermodynamic
 * quantities. For example, in the WaterSSTP class, these offsets are
 * calculated in the following way. The thermodynamic base state for water is
 * set to the NIST basis here by specifying constants EW_Offset and SW_Offset.
 * These offsets are calculated on the fly so that the following properties
 * hold:
 *
 *   - Delta_Hfo_idealGas(298.15, 1bar) = -241.826 kJ/gmol
 *   - So_idealGas(298.15, 1bar)        = 188.835 J/gmolK
 *
 * The offsets are calculated by actually computing the above quantities and
 * then calculating the correction factor.
 *
 * This class provides an interface to the WaterPropsIAPWSphi class, which
 * actually calculates the \f$ \phi^o(\delta, \tau)  \f$ and the
 * \f$ \phi^r(\delta, \tau) \f$ polynomials in dimensionless form.
 *
 * All thermodynamic results from this class are returned in dimensional form.
 * This is because the gas constant (and molecular weight) used within this
 * class is allowed to be potentially different than that used elsewhere in
 * %Cantera. Therefore, everything has to be in dimensional units. Note,
 * however, the thermodynamic basis is set to that used in the steam tables.
 * (u = s = 0 for liquid water at the triple point).
 *
 * This class is not a %ThermoPhase. However, it does maintain an internal
 * state of the object that is dependent on temperature and density. The
 * internal state is characterized by an internally stored \f$ \tau\f$ and a
 * \f$ \delta \f$ value, and an iState value, which indicates whether the
 * point is a liquid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. Along with that the
 * \f$ \tau\f$ and a \f$ \delta \f$ values are polynomials of \f$ \tau\f$ and
 * a \f$ \delta \f$ that are kept by the WaterPropsIAPWSphi class. Therefore,
 * whenever  \f$ \tau\f$ or \f$ \delta \f$ is changed, the function setState()
 * must be called in order for the internal state to be kept up to date.
 *
 * The class is pretty straightforward. However, one function deserves
 * mention. The density() function calculates the density that is consistent
 * with a particular value of the temperature and pressure. It may therefore
 * be multivalued or potentially there may be no answer from this function. It
 * therefore takes a phase guess and a density guess as optional parameters.
 * If no guesses are supplied to density(), a gas phase guess is assumed. This
 * may or may not be what is wanted. Therefore, density() should usually at
 * least be supplied with a phase guess so that it may manufacture an
 * appropriate density guess. density() manufactures the initial density
 * guess, nondimensionalizes everything, and then calls
 * WaterPropsIAPWSphi::dfind(), which does the iterative calculation to find
 * the density condition that matches the desired input pressure.
 *
 * The phase guess defines are located in the .h file. they are
 *
 *   - WATER_GAS
 *   - WATER_LIQUID
 *   - WATER_SUPERCRIT
 *
 * There are only three functions which actually change the value of the
 * internal state of this object after it's been instantiated
 *
 *   - setState_TR(temperature, rho)
 *   - density(temperature, pressure, phase, rhoguess)
 *   - psat(temperature, waterState);
 *
 * The setState_TR() is the main function that sets the temperature and rho
 * value. The density() function serves as a setState_TP() function, in that
 * it sets internal state to a temperature and pressure. However, note that
 * this is potentially multivalued. Therefore, we need to supply in addition a
 * phase guess and a rho guess to the input temperature and pressure. The
 * psat() function sets the internal state to the saturated liquid or
 * saturated gas state, depending on the waterState parameter.
 *
 * Because the underlying object WaterPropsIAPWSphi is privately held, you can
 * be sure that the underlying state of this object doesn't change except due
 * to the three function calls listed above.
