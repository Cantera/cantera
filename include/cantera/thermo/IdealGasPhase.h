//! Class IdealGasPhase represents low-density gases that obey the ideal gas
//! equation of state.
/*!
 *
 * IdealGasPhase derives from class ThermoPhase, and overloads the virtual
 * methods defined there with ones that use expressions appropriate for ideal
 * gas mixtures.
 *
 * The independent unknowns are density, mass fraction, and temperature. the
 * #setPressure() function will calculate the density consistent with the
 * current mass fraction vector and temperature and the desired pressure, and
 * then set the density.
 *
 * ## Specification of Species Standard State Properties
 *
 * It is assumed that the reference state thermodynamics may be obtained by a
 * pointer to a populated species thermodynamic property manager class in the
 * base class, ThermoPhase::m_spthermo (see the base class \link
 * Cantera::MultiSpeciesThermo MultiSpeciesThermo \endlink for a description of
 * the specification of reference state species thermodynamics functions). The
 * reference state, where the pressure is fixed at a single pressure, is a key
 * species property calculation for the Ideal Gas Equation of state.
 *
 * This class is optimized for speed of execution. All calls to thermodynamic
 * functions first call internal routines (aka #enthalpy_RT_ref()) which return
 * references the reference state thermodynamics functions. Within these
 * internal reference state functions, the function #updateThermo() is called,
 * that first checks to see whether the temperature has changed. If it has, it
 * updates the internal reference state thermo functions by calling the
 * MultiSpeciesThermo object.
 *
 * Functions for the calculation of standard state properties for species at
 * arbitrary pressure are provided in IdealGasPhase. However, they are all
 * derived from their reference state counterparts.
 *
 * The standard state enthalpy is independent of pressure:
 *
 * \f[
 *      h^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * The standard state constant-pressure heat capacity is independent of pressure:
 *
 * \f[
 *      Cp^o_k(T,P) = Cp^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * The standard state entropy depends in the following fashion on pressure:
 *
 * \f[
 *      S^o_k(T,P) = S^{ref}_k(T) -  R \ln(\frac{P}{P_{ref}})
 * \f]
 * The standard state Gibbs free energy is obtained from the enthalpy and entropy
 * functions:
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu^o_k(T,P) =  h^o_k(T,P) - S^o_k(T,P) T
 * \f]
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu^o_k(T,P) =  \mu^{ref}_k(T) + R T \ln( \frac{P}{P_{ref}})
 * \f]
 *
 * where
 * \f[
 *      \mu^{ref}_k(T) =   h^{ref}_k(T)   - T S^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * The standard state internal energy is obtained from the enthalpy function also
 *
 * \f[
 *      u^o_k(T,P) = h^o_k(T) - R T
 * \f]
 *
 * The molar volume of a species is given by the ideal gas law
 *
 * \f[
 *      V^o_k(T,P) = \frac{R T}{P}
 * \f]
 *
 * where R is the molar gas constant. For a complete list of physical constants
 * used within %Cantera, see \ref physConstants .
 *
 * ## Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties
 *
 * The activity of a species defined in the phase is given by the ideal gas law:
 * \f[
 *      a_k = X_k
 * \f]
 * where \f$ X_k \f$ is the mole fraction of species *k*. The chemical potential
 * for species *k* is equal to
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^o_k(T, P) + R T \log(X_k)
 * \f]
 *
 * In terms of the reference state, the above can be rewritten
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^{ref}_k(T, P) + R T \log(\frac{P X_k}{P_{ref}})
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar entropy for species *k* is given by the following relation,
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{s}_k(T,P) = s^o_k(T,P) - R \log(X_k) = s^{ref}_k(T) - R \log(\frac{P X_k}{P_{ref}})
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar enthalpy for species *k* is
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{h}_k(T,P) = h^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar Internal Energy for species *k* is
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{u}_k(T,P) = u^o_k(T,P) = u^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar Heat Capacity for species *k* is
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{Cp}_k(T,P) = Cp^o_k(T,P) = Cp^{ref}_k(T)
 * \f]
 *
 * ## %Application within Kinetics Managers
 *
 * \f$ C^a_k\f$ are defined such that \f$ a_k = C^a_k / C^s_k, \f$ where \f$
 * C^s_k \f$ is a standard concentration defined below and \f$ a_k \f$ are
 * activities used in the thermodynamic functions.  These activity (or
 * generalized) concentrations are used by kinetics manager classes to compute
 * the forward and reverse rates of elementary reactions. The activity
 * concentration,\f$  C^a_k \f$,is given by the following expression.
 *
 * \f[
 *      C^a_k = C^s_k  X_k  = \frac{P}{R T} X_k
 * \f]
 *
 * The standard concentration for species *k* is independent of *k* and equal to
 *
 * \f[
 *     C^s_k =  C^s = \frac{P}{R T}
 * \f]
 *
 * For example, a bulk-phase binary gas reaction between species j and k,
 * producing a new gas species l would have the following equation for its rate
 * of progress variable, \f$ R^1 \f$, which has units of kmol m-3 s-1.
 *
 * \f[
 *    R^1 = k^1 C_j^a C_k^a =  k^1 (C^s a_j) (C^s a_k)
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f[
 *    C_j^a = C^s a_j \quad \mbox{and} \quad C_k^a = C^s a_k
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$ C_j^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species j, and
 * \f$ C_k^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species k. \f$ C^s \f$ is the
 * standard concentration. \f$ a_j \f$ is the activity of species j which is
 * equal to the mole fraction of j.
 *
 * The reverse rate constant can then be obtained from the law of microscopic
 * reversibility and the equilibrium expression for the system.
 *
 * \f[
 *     \frac{a_j a_k}{ a_l} = K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^o_l - \mu^o_j - \mu^o_k}{R T} )
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$  K_a^{o,1} \f$ is the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant,
 * associated with the pressure dependent standard states \f$ \mu^o_l(T,P) \f$
 * and their associated activities, \f$ a_l \f$, repeated here:
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu_l(T,P) = \mu^o_l(T, P) + R T \log(a_l)
 * \f]
 *
 * We can switch over to expressing the equilibrium constant in terms of the
 * reference state chemical potentials
 *
 * \f[
 *     K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{P}
 * \f]
 *
 * The concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$, may be obtained by
 * changing over to activity concentrations. When this is done:
 *
 * \f[
 *       \frac{C^a_j C^a_k}{ C^a_l} = C^o K_a^{o,1} = K_c^1 =
 *           \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{RT}
 * \f]
 *
 * %Kinetics managers will calculate the concentration equilibrium constant,
 * \f$ K_c \f$, using the second and third part of the above expression as a
 * definition for the concentration equilibrium constant.
 *
 * For completeness, the pressure equilibrium constant may be obtained as well
 *
 * \f[
 *       \frac{P_j P_k}{ P_l P_{ref}} = K_p^1 =
 *           \exp\left(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$ K_p \f$ is the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for ideal gases.
 * However, it isn't necessarily the simplest form of the equilibrium constant
 * for other types of phases; \f$ K_c \f$ is used instead because it is
 * completely general.
 *
 * The reverse rate of progress may be written down as
 * \f[
 *    R^{-1} = k^{-1} C_l^a =  k^{-1} (C^o a_l)
 * \f]
 *
 * where we can use the concept of microscopic reversibility to write the
 * reverse rate constant in terms of the forward rate constant and the
 * concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$.
 *
 * \f[
 *    k^{-1} =  k^1 K^1_c
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$k^{-1} \f$ has units of s-1.
