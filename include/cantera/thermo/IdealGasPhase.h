 * %IdealGasPhase derives from class ThermoPhase,

 * use expressions appropriate for ideal gas mixtures.
 *
 * The independent unknowns are density, mass fraction, and temperature.
 * the #setPressure() function will calculate the density consistent with
 * the current mass fraction vector and temperature and the desired pressure,
 * and then set the density.

 *
 *  It is assumed that the reference state thermodynamics may be
 *  obtained by a pointer to a populated species thermodynamic property
 *  manager class in the base class, ThermoPhase::m_spthermo
 *  (see the base class \link Cantera#SpeciesThermo SpeciesThermo \endlink for a
 *  description of the specification of reference state species thermodynamics functions).
 *  The reference state,
 *  where the pressure is fixed at a single pressure,
 *  is a key species property calculation for the Ideal Gas Equation
 *  of state.
 *
 *  This class is optimized for speed of execution. All calls to thermodynamic functions
 *  first call internal routines (aka #enthalpy_RT_ref()) which return references
 *  the reference state thermodynamics functions. Within these internal reference
 *  state functions, the function #_updateThermo() is called, that first checks to see
 *  whether the temperature has changed. If it has, it updates the internal reference
 *  state thermo functions by calling the SpeciesThermo object.
 *
 *  Functions for the calculation of standard state properties for species
 *  at arbitrary pressure are provided in %IdealGasPhase. However, they
 *  are all derived from their reference state counterparts.
 *
 *  The standard state enthalpy is independent of pressure:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            h^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]
 *
 *  The standard state constant-pressure heat capacity is independent of pressure:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            Cp^o_k(T,P) = Cp^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]
 *
 *  The standard state entropy depends in the following fashion on pressure:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            S^o_k(T,P) = S^{ref}_k(T) -  R \ln(\frac{P}{P_{ref}})
 *       \f]
 *  The standard state gibbs free energy is obtained from the enthalpy and entropy
 *  functions:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu^o_k(T,P) =  h^o_k(T,P) - S^o_k(T,P) T
 *       \f]
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu^o_k(T,P) =  \mu^{ref}_k(T) + R T \ln( \frac{P}{P_{ref}})
 *       \f]
 *
 * where
 *       \f[
 *            \mu^{ref}_k(T) =   h^{ref}_k(T)   - T S^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]
 *
 *  The standard state internal energy is obtained from the enthalpy function also
 *
 *       \f[
 *            u^o_k(T,P) = h^o_k(T) - R T
 *       \f]
 *
 *  The molar volume of a species is given by the ideal gas law
 *
 *       \f[
 *            V^o_k(T,P) = \frac{R T}{P}
 *       \f]
 *
 *  where R is the molar gas constant. For a complete list of physical constants
 *  used within %Cantera, see \ref physConstants .

 *
 * The activity of a species defined in the phase is given by the ideal gas law:
 *       \f[
 *            a_k = X_k
 *       \f]
 * where \f$ X_k \f$ is the mole fraction of species <I>k</I>.
 * The chemical potential for species <I>k</I> is equal to
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^o_k(T, P) + R T \log(X_k)
 *       \f]
 *
 * In terms of the reference state, the above can be rewritten
 *
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^{ref}_k(T, P) + R T \log(\frac{P X_k}{P_{ref}})
 *       \f]
 *
 * The partial molar entropy for species <I>k</I> is given by the following relation,
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \tilde{s}_k(T,P) = s^o_k(T,P) - R \log(X_k) = s^{ref}_k(T) - R \log(\frac{P X_k}{P_{ref}})
 *       \f]
 *
 * The partial molar enthalpy for species <I>k</I> is
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \tilde{h}_k(T,P) = h^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]
 *
 * The partial molar Internal Energy for species <I>k</I> is
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \tilde{u}_k(T,P) = u^o_k(T,P) = u^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]
 *
 * The partial molar Heat Capacity for species <I>k</I> is
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \tilde{Cp}_k(T,P) = Cp^o_k(T,P) = Cp^{ref}_k(T)
 *       \f]

 *
 *   \f$ C^a_k\f$ are defined such that \f$ a_k = C^a_k /
 *   C^s_k, \f$ where \f$ C^s_k \f$ is a standard concentration
 *   defined below and \f$ a_k \f$ are activities used in the
 *   thermodynamic functions.  These activity (or generalized)
 *   concentrations are used
 *   by kinetics manager classes to compute the forward and
 *   reverse rates of elementary reactions.
 *   The activity concentration,\f$  C^a_k \f$,is given by the following expression.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            C^a_k = C^s_k  X_k  = \frac{P}{R T} X_k
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard concentration for species <I>k</I> is independent of <I>k</I> and equal to
 *
 *        \f[
 *            C^s_k =  C^s = \frac{P}{R T}
 *        \f]
 *
 * For example, a bulk-phase binary gas reaction between species j and k, producing
 * a new gas species l would have the
 * following equation for its rate of progress variable, \f$ R^1 \f$, which has
 * units of kmol m-3 s-1.
 *
 *   \f[
 *    R^1 = k^1 C_j^a C_k^a =  k^1 (C^s a_j) (C^s a_k)
 *   \f]
 *  where
 *   \f[
 *      C_j^a = C^s a_j \quad \mbox{and} \quad C_k^a = C^s a_k
 *   \f]
 *
 *  \f$ C_j^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species j, and
 *  \f$ C_k^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species k. \f$ C^s \f$
 *  is the standard concentration. \f$ a_j \f$ is
 *  the activity of species j which is equal to the mole fraction of j.
 *
 *  The reverse rate constant can then be obtained from the law of microscopic reversibility
 *  and the equilibrium expression for the system.
 *
 *   \f[
 *         \frac{a_j a_k}{ a_l} = K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^o_l - \mu^o_j - \mu^o_k}{R T} )
 *   \f]
 *
 *  \f$  K_a^{o,1} \f$ is the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant, associated with
 *  the pressure dependent standard states \f$ \mu^o_l(T,P) \f$ and their associated activities,
 *  \f$ a_l \f$, repeated here:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \mu_l(T,P) = \mu^o_l(T, P) + R T \log(a_l)
 *       \f]
 *
 *  We can switch over to expressing the equilibrium constant in terms of the reference
 *  state chemical potentials
 *
 *   \f[
 *       K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{P}
 *   \f]
 *
 *   The concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$, may be obtained by changing over
 *   to activity concentrations. When this is done:
 *
 *   \f[
 *         \frac{C^a_j C^a_k}{ C^a_l} = C^o K_a^{o,1} = K_c^1 =
 *             \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{RT}
 *   \f]
 *
 *    %Kinetics managers will calculate the concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$,
 *    using the second and third part of the above expression as a definition for the concentration
 *    equilibrium constant.
 *
 *    For completeness, the pressure equilibrium constant may be obtained as well
 *
 *   \f[
 *         \frac{P_j P_k}{ P_l P_{ref}} = K_p^1 =
               \exp\left(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} \right)
 *   \f]
 *
 *   \f$ K_p \f$ is the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for ideal gases. However, it isn't
 *   necessarily the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for other types of phases; \f$ K_c \f$ is
 *   used instead because it is completely general.
 *
 *   The reverse rate of progress may be written down as
 *   \f[
 *    R^{-1} = k^{-1} C_l^a =  k^{-1} (C^o a_l)
 *   \f]
 *
 *  where we can use the concept of microscopic reversibility to
 *  write the reverse rate constant in terms of the
 *  forward rate constant and the concentration equilibrium
 *   constant, \f$ K_c \f$.
 *
 *    \f[
 *       k^{-1} =  k^1 K^1_c
 *    \f]
 *
 *  \f$k^{-1} \f$ has units of s-1.
