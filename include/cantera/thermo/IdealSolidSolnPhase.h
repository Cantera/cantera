 * class derives from class ThermoPhase, and overloads the virtual methods
 * defined there with ones that use expressions appropriate for ideal solution
 * mixtures.
 *
 * The generalized concentrations can have three different forms depending on
 * the value of the member attribute #m_formGC, which is supplied in the
 * constructor and in the input file. The value and form of the generalized
 * concentration will affect reaction rate constants involving species in this
