/**
 * @defgroup phases Models of Phases of Matter
 *
 * These classes are used to represent the composition and state of a single
 * phase of matter. Together these classes form the basis for describing the
 * species and element compositions of a phase as well as the stoichiometry
 * of each species, and for describing the current state of the phase. They do
 * not in themselves contain Thermodynamic equation of state information.
 * However, they do comprise all of the necessary background functionality to
 * support thermodynamic calculations (see \ref thermoprops).
 */

//! Class Phase is the base class for phases of matter, managing the species and
//! elements in a phase, as well as the independent variables of temperature,
//! mass density (compressible substances) or pressure (incompressible
//! substances), species mass/mole fraction, and other generalized forces and
//! intrinsic properties (such as electric potential) that define the
//! thermodynamic state.
/*!
 *
 * Class Phase provides information about the elements and species in a
 * phase - names, index numbers (location in arrays), atomic or molecular
 * weights, etc. The set of elements must include all those that compose the
 * species, but may include additional elements.
 *
 * It also stores an array of species molecular weights, which are used to
 * convert between mole and mass representations of the composition. For
 * efficiency in mass/mole conversion, the vector of mass fractions divided
 * by molecular weight \f$ Y_k/M_k \f$ is also stored.
 *
 * Class Phase is not usually used directly. Its primary use is as a base class
 * for class ThermoPhase. It is not generally necessary to overloaded any of
 * class Phase's methods, which handles both compressible and incompressible
 * phases. For incompressible phases, the density is replaced by the pressure
 * as the independent variable, and can no longer be set directly. In this case,
 * the density needs to be calculated from a suitable equation of state, and
 * assigned to the object using the assignDensity() method. This also applies
 * for nearly-incompressible phases or phases which utilize standard states
 * based on a T and P, in which case they need to overload these functions too.
 *
 * Class Phase contains a number of utility functions that will set the state
 * of the phase in its entirety, by first setting the composition, then the
 * temperature and then density (or pressure for incompressible substances)
 * An example of this is the function
 * Phase::setState_TRY(double t, double dens, const double* y).
 *
 * Class Phase contains methods for saving and restoring the full internal state
 * of a given phase. These are saveState() and restoreState(). These functions
 * operate on a state vector, which by default uses the first two entries for
 * temperature and density (compressible substances) or temperature and
 * pressure (incompressible substances). If the substance is not pure in a
 * thermodynamic sense (that is, it may contain multiple species), the state also
 * contains nSpecies() entries that specify the composition by corresponding
 * mass fractions. Default definitions can be overloaded by derived classes.
 * For any phase, the native definition of its thermodynamic state is defined
 * the method nativeState(), with the length of the state vector returned by
 * by stateSize(). In addition, methods isPure() and isCompressible() provide
 * information on the implementation of a Phase object.
 *
 * A species name is referred to via speciesName(), which is unique within a
 * given phase. Note that within multiphase mixtures (MultiPhase()), both a
 * phase name/index as well as species name are required to access information
 * about a species in a particular phase. For surfaces, the species names are
 * unique among the phases.
 *
 * @todo
 *   - Specify that the input mole, mass, and volume fraction vectors must sum
 *     to one on entry to the set state routines. Non-conforming mole/mass
 *     fraction vectors are not thermodynamically consistent. Moreover, unless
 *     we do this, the calculation of Jacobians will be altered whenever the
 *     treatment of non- conforming mole fractions is changed. Add setState
 *     functions corresponding to specifying mole numbers, which is actually
 *     what is being done (well one of the options, there are many) when non-
 *     conforming mole fractions are input. Note, we realize that most numerical
 *     Jacobian and some analytical Jacobians use non-conforming calculations.
 *     These can easily be changed to the set mole number setState functions.
