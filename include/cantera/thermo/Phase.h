/*!
 *
 * Class Phase manages the species and elements in a phase, as well as the
 * independent variables of temperature, mass density, and species mass/mole
 * fraction that define the thermodynamic state.
 *
 * Class Phase provides information about the elements and species in a
 * phase - names, index numbers (location in arrays), atomic or molecular
 * weights, etc. The set of elements must include all those that compose the
 * species, but may include additional elements.
 *
 * It also stores an array of species molecular weights, which are used to
 * convert between mole and mass representations of the composition. For
 * efficiency in mass/mole conversion, the vector of mass fractions divided
 * by molecular weight \f$ Y_k/M_k \f$ is also stored.
 *
 * Class Phase is not usually used directly. Its primary use is as a base class
 * for class ThermoPhase. It is not generally necessary to overloaded any of
 * class Phase's methods, with the exception of incompressible phases. In that
 * case, the density must be replaced by the pressure as the independent
 * variable and functions such as setMassFraction within class Phase must
 * actually now calculate the density (at constant T and P) instead of leaving
 * it alone as befits an independent variable. This also applies for nearly-
 * incompressible phases or phases which utilize standard states based on a
 * T and P, in which case they need to overload these functions too.
 *
 * Class Phase contains a number of utility functions that will set the state
 * of the phase in its entirety, by first setting the composition, then the
 * temperature and then the density. An example of this is the function
 * Phase::setState_TRY(double t, double dens, const double* y).
 *
 * Class Phase contains method for saving and restoring the full internal
 * states of each phase. These are saveState() and restoreState(). These
 * functions operate on a state vector, which is in general of length
 * (2 + nSpecies()). The first two entries of the state vector are temperature
 * and density.
 *
 * A species name may be referred to via three methods:
 *
 *    -   "speciesName"
 *    -   "PhaseId:speciesName"
 *    -   "phaseName:speciesName"
 *    .
 *
 * The first two methods of naming may not yield a unique species within
 * complicated assemblies of %Cantera Phases.
 *
 * @todo Make the concept of saving state vectors more general, so that it can
 * handle other cases where there are additional internal state variables, such
 * as the voltage, a potential energy, or a strain field.
