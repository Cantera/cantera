//! MargulesVPSSTP is a derived class of GibbsExcessVPSSTP that employs the
//! Margules approximation for the excess Gibbs free energy
/*!
 * MargulesVPSSTP derives from class GibbsExcessVPSSTP which is derived from
 * VPStandardStateTP, and overloads the virtual methods defined there with ones
 * that use expressions appropriate for the Margules Excess Gibbs free energy
 * approximation.
 *
 * The independent unknowns are pressure, temperature, and mass fraction.
 *
 * ## Specification of Species Standard State Properties
 *
 * All species are defined to have standard states that depend upon both the
 * temperature and the pressure. The Margules approximation assumes symmetric
 * standard states, where all of the standard state assume that the species are
 * in pure component states at the temperature and pressure of the solution.  I
 * don't think it prevents, however, some species from being dilute in the
 * solution.
 *
 * ## Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties
 *
 * The molar excess Gibbs free energy is given by the following formula which is
 * a sum over interactions *i*. Each of the interactions are binary interactions
 * involving two of the species in the phase, denoted, *Ai* and *Bi*. This is
 * the generalization of the Margules formulation for a phase that has more than
 * 2 species.
 *
 * \f[
 *     G^E = \sum_i \left(  H_{Ei} - T S_{Ei} \right)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *    H^E_i = n X_{Ai} X_{Bi} \left( h_{o,i} +  h_{1,i} X_{Bi} \right)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *    S^E_i = n X_{Ai} X_{Bi} \left( s_{o,i} +  s_{1,i} X_{Bi} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * where n is the total moles in the solution.
 *
 * The activity of a species defined in the phase is given by an excess Gibbs
 * free energy formulation.
 *
 * \f[
 *      a_k = \gamma_k  X_k
 * \f]
 *
 * where
 *
 * \f[
 *      R T \ln( \gamma_k )= \frac{d(n G^E)}{d(n_k)}\Bigg|_{n_i}
 * \f]
 *
 * Taking the derivatives results in the following expression
 *
 * \f[
 *      R T \ln( \gamma_k )= \sum_i \left( \left( \delta_{Ai,k} X_{Bi} + \delta_{Bi,k} X_{Ai}  - X_{Ai} X_{Bi} \right)
 *       \left( g^E_{o,i} +  g^E_{1,i} X_{Bi} \right) +
 *       \left( \delta_{Bi,k} - X_{Bi} \right)      X_{Ai} X_{Bi}  g^E_{1,i} \right)
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f$  g^E_{o,i} =  h_{o,i} - T s_{o,i} \f$ and
 * \f$ g^E_{1,i} =  h_{1,i} - T s_{1,i} \f$ and where
 * \f$ X_k \f$ is the mole fraction of species *k*.
 *
 * This object inherits from the class VPStandardStateTP. Therefore, the
 * specification and calculation of all standard state and reference state
 * values are handled at that level. Various functional forms for the standard
 * state are permissible. The chemical potential for species *k* is equal to
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu_k(T,P) = \mu^o_k(T, P) + R T \ln(\gamma_k X_k)
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar entropy for species *k* is given by
 *
 * \f[
 *       \tilde{s}_k(T,P) =  s^o_k(T,P)  - R \ln( \gamma_k X_k )
 *              - R T \frac{d \ln(\gamma_k) }{dT}
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar enthalpy for species *k* is given by
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{h}_k(T,P) = h^o_k(T,P) - R T^2 \frac{d \ln(\gamma_k)}{dT}
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar volume for species *k* is
 *
 * \f[
 *        \tilde V_k(T,P)  = V^o_k(T,P)  + R T \frac{d \ln(\gamma_k) }{dP}
 * \f]
 *
 * The partial molar Heat Capacity for species *k* is
 *
 * \f[
 *      \tilde{C}_{p,k}(T,P) = C^o_{p,k}(T,P)   - 2 R T \frac{d \ln( \gamma_k )}{dT}
 *              - R T^2 \frac{d^2 \ln(\gamma_k) }{{dT}^2}
 * \f]
 *
 * ## %Application within Kinetics Managers
 *
 * \f$ C^a_k\f$ are defined such that \f$ a_k = C^a_k / C^s_k, \f$ where
 * \f$ C^s_k \f$ is a standard concentration defined below and \f$ a_k \f$ are
 * activities used in the thermodynamic functions.  These activity (or
 * generalized) concentrations are used by kinetics manager classes to compute
 * the forward and reverse rates of elementary reactions. The activity
 * concentration,\f$  C^a_k \f$,is given by the following expression.
 *
 * \f[
 *      C^a_k = C^s_k  X_k  = \frac{P}{R T} X_k
 * \f]
 *
 * The standard concentration for species *k* is independent of *k* and equal to
 *
 * \f[
 *     C^s_k =  C^s = \frac{P}{R T}
 * \f]
 *
 * For example, a bulk-phase binary gas reaction between species j and k,
 * producing a new gas species l would have the following equation for its rate
 * of progress variable, \f$ R^1 \f$, which has units of kmol m-3 s-1.
 *
 * \f[
 *    R^1 = k^1 C_j^a C_k^a =  k^1 (C^s a_j) (C^s a_k)
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f[
 *    C_j^a = C^s a_j \mbox{\quad and \quad} C_k^a = C^s a_k
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$ C_j^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species j, and \f$ C_k^a \f$
 * is the activity concentration of species k. \f$ C^s \f$ is the standard
 * concentration. \f$ a_j \f$ is the activity of species j which is equal to the
 * mole fraction of j.
 *
 * The reverse rate constant can then be obtained from the law of microscopic
 * reversibility and the equilibrium expression for the system.
 *
 * \f[
 *       \frac{a_j a_k}{ a_l} = K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^o_l - \mu^o_j - \mu^o_k}{R T} )
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$  K_a^{o,1} \f$ is the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant,
 * associated with the pressure dependent standard states \f$ \mu^o_l(T,P) \f$
 * and their associated activities, \f$ a_l \f$, repeated here:
 *
 * \f[
 *      \mu_l(T,P) = \mu^o_l(T, P) + R T \log(a_l)
 * \f]
 *
 * We can switch over to expressing the equilibrium constant in terms of the
 * reference state chemical potentials
 *
 * \f[
 *     K_a^{o,1} = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{P}
 * \f]
 *
 * The concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$, may be obtained by
 * changing over to activity concentrations. When this is done:
 *
 * \f[
 *       \frac{C^a_j C^a_k}{ C^a_l} = C^o K_a^{o,1} = K_c^1 =
 *           \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} ) * \frac{P_{ref}}{RT}
 * \f]
 *
 * %Kinetics managers will calculate the concentration equilibrium constant, \f$
 * K_c \f$, using the second and third part of the above expression as a
 * definition for the concentration equilibrium constant.
 *
 * For completeness, the pressure equilibrium constant may be obtained as well
 *
 * \f[
 *     \frac{P_j P_k}{ P_l P_{ref}} = K_p^1 = \exp(\frac{\mu^{ref}_l - \mu^{ref}_j - \mu^{ref}_k}{R T} )
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$ K_p \f$ is the simplest form of the equilibrium constant for ideal gases.
 * However, it isn't necessarily the simplest form of the equilibrium constant
 * for other types of phases; \f$ K_c \f$ is used instead because it is
 * completely general.
 *
 * The reverse rate of progress may be written down as
 * \f[
 *    R^{-1} = k^{-1} C_l^a =  k^{-1} (C^o a_l)
 * \f]
 *
 * where we can use the concept of microscopic reversibility to write the
 * reverse rate constant in terms of the forward rate constant and the
 * concentration equilibrium constant, \f$ K_c \f$.
 *
 * \f[
 *    k^{-1} =  k^1 K^1_c
 * \f]
 *
 * \f$k^{-1} \f$ has units of s-1.
