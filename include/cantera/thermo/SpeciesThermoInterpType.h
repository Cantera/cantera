  * @defgroup spthermo Species Reference-State Thermodynamic Properties
  *
  *  The %ThermoPhase object relies on classes to calculate the thermodynamic
  *  properties of the reference state for all of the species in the phase.
  *  This group describes the types and functionality of the classes that
  *  calculate the reference state thermodynamic functions within %Cantera.
  *
  * To compute the thermodynamic properties of multicomponent
  * solutions, it is necessary to know something about the
  * thermodynamic properties of the individual species present in
  * the solution. Exactly what sort of species properties are
  * required depends on the thermodynamic model for the
  * solution. For a gaseous solution (i.e., a gas mixture), the
  * species properties required are usually ideal gas properties at
  * the mixture temperature and at a reference pressure (almost always at
  * 1 bar). For other types of solutions, however, it may
  * not be possible to isolate the species in a "pure" state. For
  * example, the thermodynamic properties of, say, Na+ and Cl- in
  * saltwater are not easily determined from data on the properties
  * of solid NaCl, or solid Na metal, or chlorine gas. In this
  * case, the solvation in water is fundamental to the identity of
  * the species, and some other reference state must be used. One
  * common convention for liquid solutions is to use thermodynamic
  * data for the solutes in the limit of infinite dilution within the
  * pure solvent; another convention is to reference all properties
  * to unit molality.
  *
  * In defining these standard states for species in a phase, we make
  * the following definition. A reference state is a standard state
  * of a species in a phase limited to one particular pressure, the reference
  * pressure. The reference state specifies the dependence of all
  * thermodynamic functions as a function of the temperature, in
  * between a minimum temperature and a maximum temperature. The
  * reference state also specifies the molar volume of the species
  * as a function of temperature. The molar volume is a thermodynamic
  * function.
  * A full standard state does the same thing as a reference state,
  * but specifies the thermodynamics functions at all pressures.
  *
  * Whatever the conventions used by a particular solution model,
  * means need to be provided to compute the species properties in
  * the reference state. Class SpeciesThermo is the base class
  * for a family of classes that compute properties of all
  * species in a phase in their reference states, for a range of temperatures.
  * Note, the pressure dependence of the species thermodynamic functions is not
  * handled by this particular species thermodynamic model. %SpeciesThermo
  * calculates the reference-state thermodynamic values of all species in a single
  * phase during each call.
  *
  * The class SpeciesThermoInterpType is a pure virtual base class for
  * calculation of thermodynamic functions for a single species
  * in its reference state.
  * The following classes inherit from %SpeciesThermoInterpType.
  *
  *   - NasaPoly1          in file NasaPoly1.h
  *      - This is a one zone model,  consisting of a 7
  *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
  *      .
  *   - NasaPoly2          in file NasaPoly2.h
  *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
  *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
  *      .
  *   - ShomatePoly        in file ShomatePoly.h
  *      - This is a one zone model, consisting of a 7
  *        coefficient Shomate Polynomial format.
  *      .
  *   - ShomatePoly2       in file ShomatePoly.h
  *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
  *        coefficient Shomate Polynomial format.
  *      .
  *   - ConstCpPoly        in file ConstCpPoly.h
  *      - This is a one-zone constant heat capacity model.
  *      .
  *   - Mu0Poly            in file Mu0Poly.h
  *      - This is a multizoned model. The chemical potential is given
  *        at a set number of temperatures. Between each temperature
  *        the heat capacity is treated as a constant.
  *      .
  *   - Nasa9Poly1          in file Nasa9Poly1.h
  *      - This is a one zone model,  consisting of the 9
  *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
  *      .
  *   - Nasa9PolyMultiTempRegion       in file Nasa9PolyMultiTempRegion.h
  *      - This is a multiple zone model, consisting of the 9
  *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format in each zone.
  *      .
  *   - STITbyPDSS          in file SpeciesThermoInterpType.h
  *      - This is an object that calculates reference state thermodynamic
  *        functions by relying on a pressure dependent
  *        standard state object (i.e., a PDSS object) to calculate
  *        the thermodynamic functions.
  *      .
  *
  *  The most important member function for the SpeciesThermoInterpType class
  *  is the member function
  *  \link SpeciesThermoInterpType::updatePropertiesTemp() updatePropertiesTemp()\endlink.
  *  The function calculates the values of Cp, H, and S for the specific
  *  species pertaining to this class. It takes as its arguments the
  *  base pointer for the vector of  Cp, H, and S values for all species
  *  in the phase. The offset for the species is known within the
  *  object.
  *
  *  A key concept for reference states is that there is a maximum and a minimum
  *  temperature beyond which the thermodynamic formulation isn't valid.
  *  Calls for temperatures outside this range will cause the
  *  object to throw a CanteraError.

//!  Pure Virtual Base class for the thermodynamic manager for
//!  an individual species' reference state
/*!
 * This differs from the SpeciesThermo virtual
 * base class in the sense that this class is meant to handle only
 * one species. The speciesThermo class is meant to handle the
 * calculation of all the species (or a large subset) in a phase.
 *
 * One key feature is that the update routines use the same
 * form as the update routines in the speciesThermo class. They update
 * into a vector of cp_R, s_R, and H_R that spans all of the species in
 * a phase. Therefore, this class must carry along a species index into that
 * vector.
 *
 * These routine may be templated. A key requirement of the template is that
 * there is a constructor with the following form:
 *
 *  @code
 *   SpeciesThermoInterpType(int index, doublereal tlow, doublereal thigh,
 *                           doublereal pref,  const doublereal* coeffs)
