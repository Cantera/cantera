 * The IonsFromNeutralVPSSTP is a derived class of ThermoPhase
 * that handles the specification of the chemical potentials for
 * ionic species, given a specification of the chemical potentials
 * for the same phase expressed in terms of combinations of the
 * ionic species that represent neutral molecules. It's expected
 * that the neutral molecules will be represented in terms of
 * an excess Gibbs free energy approximation that is a derivative
 * of the GbbsExcessVPSSTP object. All of the e Excess Gibbs free
 *  energy formulations in this area employ
 *  symmetrical formulations.
 *
 *  This class is used for molten salts.
 *
 *  This object actually employs 4 different mole fraction types.
 *
 *  1. There is a mole fraction associated the the cations and
 *     anions and neutrals from this ThermoPhase object. This
 *     is the normal mole fraction vector for this object.
 *     Note, however, it isn't the appropriate mole fraction
 *     vector to use even for obtaining the correct ideal
 *     free energies of mixing.
 *  2. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the
 *     neutral molecule ThermoPhase object.
 *  3. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the
 *     cation lattice.
 *  4. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the
 *     anion lattice
 *
 *  This object can translate between any of the four mole
 *  fraction representations.
