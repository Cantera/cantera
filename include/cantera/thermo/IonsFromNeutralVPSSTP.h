 * The IonsFromNeutralVPSSTP is a derived class of ThermoPhase that handles the
 * specification of the chemical potentials for ionic species, given a
 * specification of the chemical potentials for the same phase expressed in
 * terms of combinations of the ionic species that represent neutral molecules.
 * It's expected that the neutral molecules will be represented in terms of an
 * excess Gibbs free energy approximation that is a derivative of the
 * GibbsExcessVPSSTP object. All of the excess Gibbs free energy formulations in
 * this area employ symmetrical formulations.
 *
 * @attention This class currently does not have any test cases or examples. Its
 *     implementation may be incomplete, and future changes to Cantera may
 *     unexpectedly cause this class to stop working. If you use this class,
 *     please consider contributing examples or test cases. In the absence of
 *     new tests or examples, this class may be deprecated and removed in a
 *     future version of Cantera. See
 *     https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/issues/267 for additional information.
 *
 * This class is used for molten salts.
 *
 * This object actually employs 4 different mole fraction types.
 *
 *  1. There is a mole fraction associated the the cations and anions and
 *     neutrals from this ThermoPhase object. This is the normal mole fraction
 *     vector for this object. Note, however, it isn't the appropriate mole
 *     fraction vector to use even for obtaining the correct ideal free energies
 *     of mixing.
 *  2. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the neutral molecule
 *     ThermoPhase object.
 *  3. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the cation lattice.
 *  4. There is a mole fraction vector associated with the anion lattice
 *
 *  This object can translate between any of the four mole fraction
 *  representations.
