/*!
 *  MolarityIonicVPSSTP is a derived class of GibbsExcessVPSSTP that handles
 *  variable pressure standard state methods for calculating
 *  thermodynamic properties that are further based on
 *  expressing the Excess Gibbs free energy as a function of
 *  the mole fractions (or pseudo mole fractions) of the constituents.
 *  This category is the workhorse for describing ionic systems which are not on the molality scale.
 *
 *  This class adds additional functions onto the ThermoPhase interface
 *  that handles the calculation of the excess Gibbs free energy. The ThermoPhase
 *  class includes a member function, ThermoPhase::activityConvention()
 *  that indicates which convention the activities are based on. The
 *  default is to assume activities are based on the molar convention.
 *  That default is used here.
 *
 *  All of the Excess Gibbs free energy formulations in this area employ
 *  symmetrical formulations.
 *
 *  This layer will massage the mole fraction vector to implement
 *  cation and anion based mole numbers in an optional manner, such that
 *  it is expected that there exists a charge balance at all times.
 *  One of the ions must be a "special ion" in the sense that its' thermodynamic
 *  functions are set to zero, and the thermo functions of all other
 *  ions are based on a valuation relative to that special ion.
