/*!
 * GibbsExcessVPSSTP is a derived class of ThermoPhase that handles variable
 * pressure standard state methods for calculating thermodynamic properties that
 * are further based on expressing the Excess Gibbs free energy as a function of
 * the mole fractions (or pseudo mole fractions) of constituents. This category
 * is the workhorse for describing molten salts, solid-phase mixtures of
 * semiconductors, and mixtures of miscible and semi-miscible compounds.
 *
 * It includes
 *   - regular solutions
 *   - Margules expansions
 *   - NTRL equation
 *   - Wilson's equation
 *   - UNIQUAC equation of state.
 *
 * This class adds additional functions onto the ThermoPhase interface that
 * handles the calculation of the excess Gibbs free energy. The ThermoPhase
 * class includes a member function, ThermoPhase::activityConvention() that
 * indicates which convention the activities are based on. The default is to
 * assume activities are based on the molar convention. That default is used
 * here.
 *
 * All of the Excess Gibbs free energy formulations in this area employ
 * symmetrical formulations.
 *
 * Chemical potentials of species k, \f$ \mu_o \f$, has the following general
 * format:
 *
 * \f[
 *    \mu_k = \mu^o_k(T,P) + R T ln( \gamma_k X_k )
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$ \gamma_k^{\triangle} \f$ is a molar based activity coefficient for
 * species \f$k\f$.
 *
 * GibbsExcessVPSSTP contains an internal vector with the current mole fraction
 * vector. That's one of its primary usages. In order to keep the mole fraction
 * vector constant, all of the setState functions are redesigned at this layer.
 *
 * ### Activity Concentrations: Relationship of ThermoPhase to %Kinetics Expressions
 *
 * As explained in a similar discussion in the ThermoPhase class, the actual
 * units used in kinetics expressions must be specified in the ThermoPhase class
 * for the corresponding species. These units vary with the field of study.
 * %Cantera uses the concept of activity concentrations to represent this.
 * Activity concentrations are used directly in the expressions for kinetics.
 * Standard concentrations are used as the multiplicative constant that takes
 * the activity of a species and turns it into an activity concentration.
 * Standard concentrations must not depend on the concentration of the species
 * in the phase.
 *
 * Here we set a standard for the specification of the standard concentrations
 * for this class and all child classes underneath it. We specify here that the
 * standard concentration is equal to 1 for all species. Therefore, the
 * activities appear directly in kinetics expressions involving species in
 * underlying GibbsExcessVPSSTP phases.
 *
 * ### SetState Strategy
 *
 * All setState functions that set the internal state of the ThermoPhase object
 * are overloaded at this level, so that a current mole fraction vector is
 * maintained within the object.
