/**
 * @defgroup mgrpdssthermocalc Managers for Calculating Standard-State Thermodynamics
 *
 * To compute the thermodynamic properties of multicomponent solutions, it is
 * necessary to know something about the thermodynamic properties of the
 * individual species present in the solution. Exactly what sort of species
 * properties are required depends on the thermodynamic model for the
 * solution. For a gaseous solution (i.e., a gas mixture), the species
 * properties required are usually ideal gas properties at the mixture
 * temperature and at a reference pressure (almost always at 1 bar). For other
 * types of solutions, however, it may not be possible to isolate the species
 * in a "pure" state. For example, the thermodynamic properties of, say, Na+
 * and Cl- in saltwater are not easily determined from data on the properties
 * of solid NaCl, or solid Na metal, or chlorine gas. In this case, the
 * solvation in water is fundamental to the identity of the species, and some
 * other reference state must be used. One common convention for liquid
 * solutions is to use thermodynamic data for the solutes in the limit of
 * infinite dilution within the pure solvent; another convention is to
 * reference all properties to unit molality.
 *
 * In defining these standard states for species in a phase, we make the
 * following definition. A reference state is a standard state of a species in
 * a phase limited to one particular pressure, the reference pressure. The
 * reference state specifies the dependence of all thermodynamic functions as
 * a function of the temperature, in between a minimum temperature and a
 * maximum temperature. The reference state also specifies the molar volume of
 * the species as a function of temperature. The molar volume is a
 * thermodynamic function. A full standard state does the same thing as a
 * reference state, but specifies the thermodynamics functions at all
 * pressures.
 *
 * Class VPSSMgr is the base class for a family of classes that compute
 * properties of all species in a phase in their standard states, for a range
 * of temperatures and pressures.
 *
 * Phases which use the VPSSMGr class must have their respective ThermoPhase
 * objects actually be derivatives of the VPStandardState class. These classes
 * assume that there exists a standard state for each species in the phase,
 * where the Thermodynamic functions are specified as a function of
 * temperature and pressure.  Standard state thermo objects for each species
 * in the phase are all derived from the PDSS virtual base class. Calculators
 * for these standard state thermo , which coordinate the calculation for all
 * of the species in a phase, are all derived from VPSSMgr. In turn, these
 * standard states may employ reference state calculation to aid in their
 * calculations. And the VPSSMgr calculators may also employ SimpleThermo
 * calculators to help in calculating the properties for all of the species in
 * a phase. However, there are some PDSS objects which do not employ reference
 * state calculations. An example of this is a real equation of state for
 * liquid water used within the calculation of brine thermodynamics.
 *
 * Typically calls to calculate standard state thermo properties are virtual
 * calls at the ThermoPhase level. It is left to the child classes of
 * ThermoPhase to specify how these are carried out. Usually, this will
 * involve calling the m_spthermo pointer to a SpeciesThermo object to
 * calculate the reference state thermodynamic properties. Then, the pressure
 * dependence is added in within the child ThermoPhase object to complete the
 * specification of the standard state. The VPStandardStateTP class, however,
 * redefines the calls to the calculation of standard state properties to use
 * VPSSMgr class calls.  A listing of these classes and important pointers are
 * supplied below.
 *
 *     - ThermoPhase
 *          - \link Cantera::ThermoPhase::m_spthermo m_spthermo\endlink
 *                 This is a pointer to a %SpeciesThermo manager class that
 *                 handles the reference %state Thermodynamic calculations.
 *     - VPStandardStateTP (inherits from %ThermoPhase)
 *          - \link Cantera::ThermoPhase::m_spthermo m_spthermo\endlink
 *                 %SpeciesThermo manager handling reference %state Thermodynamic calculations.
 *                  may or may not be used by the VPSSMgr class. For species
 *                  which don't have a reference state class defined, a default
 *                  class, called STITbyPDSS which is installed into the SpeciesThermo
 *                  class, actually calculates reference state
 *                  thermo by calling a PDSS object.
 *          - \link Cantera::VPStandardStateTP::m_VPSS_ptr m_VPSS_ptr\endlink
 *                  This is a pointer to a %VPSSMgr class which handles the
 *                  standard %state thermo calculations. It may
 *                  or may not use the pointer, m_spthermo, in its calculations.
 *
 *   The following classes inherit from VPSSMgr. Each of these classes
 *   handle multiple species and by definition all of the species in a phase.
 *   It is a requirement that a VPSSMgr object handles all of the
 *   species in a phase.
 *
 *   - VPSSMgr_IdealGas
 *      - standardState model = "IdealGas"
 *      - This model assumes that all species in the phase obey the
 *        ideal gas law for their pressure dependence. The manager
 *        uses a SpeciesThermo object to handle the calculation of the
 *        reference state.
 *   - VPSSMgr_ConstVol
 *      - standardState model = "ConstVol"
 *      - This model assumes that all species in the phase obey the
 *        constant partial molar volume pressure dependence.
 *        The manager uses a SpeciesThermo object to handle the
 *        calculation of the reference state.
 *   - VPSSMgr_Water_ConstVol
 *      - standardState model = "Water_ConstVol"
 *      - This model assumes that all species but one in the phase obey the
 *        constant partial molar volume pressure dependence.
 *        The manager uses a SpeciesThermo object to handle the
 *        calculation of the reference state for those species.
 *        Species 0 is assumed to be water, and a real equation
 *        of state is used to model the T, P behavior.
 *   - VPSSMgr_Water_HKFT
 *      - standardState model = "Water_HKFT"
 *      - This model assumes that all species but one in the phase obey the
 *        HKFT equation of state.
 *        Species 0 is assumed to be water, and a real equation
 *        of state is used to model the T, P behavior.
 *   - VPSSMgr_General
 *      - standardState model = "General"
 *      - This model is completely general. Nothing is assumed at this
 *        level. Calls consist of loops to PDSS property evaluations.
 *
 *  The choice of which VPSSMgr object to be used is implicitly made by
 *  %Cantera by querying the XML data file for compatibility.
 *  However, each of these VPSSMgr objects may be explicitly requested in the XML file
 *  by adding in the following XML node into the thermo section of the
 *  phase XML Node. For example, the code example listed below
 *  explicitly requests that the VPSSMgr_IdealGas
 *  object be used to handle the standard state thermodynamics calculations.
 *
 *  @code
 *    <phase id="Silane_Pyrolysis" dim="3">
 *       . . .
 *       <thermo model="VPIdealGas">
 *          <standardState model="IdealGas"\>
 *       <\thermo>
 *       . . .
 *    <\phase>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  If it turns out that the VPSSMgr_IdealGas class can not handle the standard
 *  state calculation, then %Cantera will fail during the instantiation phase
 *  printing out an informative error message.
 *
 *  In the source code listing above, the thermo model, VPIdealGas ,was requested. The
 *  thermo model specifies the type of ThermoPhase object to use. In this case
 *  the object IdealSolnGasVPSS (with the ideal gas suboption) is used. IdealSolnGasVPSS
 *  inherits from VPStandardStateTP, so that it actually has a VPSSMgr pointer
 *  to be specified. Note, in addition to the IdealGas entry to the model
 *  parameter in standardState node, we could have also specified the "General"
 *  option. The general option will always work. An example of this
 *  usage is listed below.
 *
 *  @code
 *    <phase id="Silane_Pyrolysis" dim="3">
 *       . . .
 *       <thermo model="VPIdealGas">
 *          <standardState model="General"\>
 *       <\thermo>
 *       . . .
 *    <\phase>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The "General" option will cause the VPSSMgr_General %VPSSMgr class to be
 *  used. In this manager, the calculations are all handled at the PDSS object
 *  level. This is completely general, but, may be significantly slower.
