//!  Class %FixedChemPotSSTP represents a stoichiometric (fixed
//!   composition)  incompressible substance.
/*!
 * This class internally changes the independent degree of freedom from
 * density to pressure. This is necessary because the phase is
 * incompressible. It uses a zero volume approximation.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Species Standard %State Properties </b>
 *
 *  This class inherits from SingleSpeciesTP.
 *  It uses a single value for the chemical potential which is assumed to be constant
 *  with respect to temperature and pressure.
 *
 *  The reference state thermodynamics is inherited from SingleSpeciesTP. However,
 *  it's only used to set the initial chemical potential to the value
 *  of the chemical potential at the starting conditions. Thereafter,
 *  it is ignored.
 *
 *  For a zero volume material, the internal energy and the enthalpy are
 *  equal to the chemical potential. The entropy, the heat capacity, and the molar volume
 *  are equal to zero.
 *
 * <b> Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties </b>
 *
 *  All solution properties are obtained from the standard state
 *  species functions, since there is only one species in the phase.
 *
 * <b> Application within %Kinetics Managers </b>
 *
 * The standard concentration is equal to 1.0. This means that the
 * kinetics operator works on an (activities basis). Since this
 * is a stoichiometric substance, this means that the concentration
 * of this phase drops out of kinetics expressions.
 *
 * An example of a reaction using this is a sticking coefficient
 * reaction of a substance in an ideal gas phase on a surface with a bulk phase
 * species in this phase. In this case, the rate of progress for this
 * reaction, \f$ R_s \f$, may be expressed via the following equation:
 *   \f[
 *    R_s = k_s C_{gas}
 *   \f]
 * where the units for \f$ R_s \f$ are kmol m-2 s-1. \f$ C_{gas} \f$ has units
 * of kmol m-3. Therefore, the kinetic rate constant,  \f$ k_s \f$, has
 * units of m s-1. Nowhere does the concentration of the bulk phase
 * appear in the rate constant expression, since it's a stoichiometric
 * phase, and the activity is always equal to 1.0.
 *
 * <b> Instantiation of the Class </b>
 *
 * This phase may be instantiated by calling the default ThermoFactory routine
 * for %Cantera. This new %FixedChemPotSSTP object must then have a standalone xml file
 * description an example of which is given below.
 *
 * It may also be created by the following code snippets. The code
 * includes the special member function setChemicalPotential( chempot), which
 * sets the chemical potential to a specific value in J / kmol.
 *
 * @code
 *    sprintf(file_ID,"%s#Li(Fixed)", iFile);
 *    XML_Node *xm = get_XML_NameID("phase", file_ID, 0);
 *    FixedChemPotSSTP *LiFixed = new FixedChemPotSSTP(*xm);
      // Set the chemical potential to -2.3E7 J/kmol
 *    LiFixed->setChemicalPotential(-2.3E7.)
 * @endcode
 *
 * or by the following call to importPhase():
 *
 * @code
 *    sprintf(file_ID,"%s#NaCl(S)", iFile);
 *    XML_Node *xm = get_XML_NameID("phase", file_ID, 0);
 *    FixedChemPotSSTP solid;
 *    importPhase(*xm, &solid);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The phase may also be created by a special constructor so that element
 * potentials may be set. The constructor takes the name of the element and
 * the value of the element chemical potential. An example is given below.
 *
 * @code
 *     FixedChemPotSSTP *LiFixed = new FixedChemPotSSTP("Li", -2.3E7);
 * @endcode
 *

 * as the model attribute of the thermo XML element entry.
