 * Class %DebyeHuckel represents a dilute liquid electrolyte phase which
 * obeys the Debye Huckel formulation for nonideality.
 *
 * The concentrations of the ionic species are assumed to obey the electroneutrality
 * condition.
 *
 * <HR>
 * <H2> Specification of Species Standard %State Properties </H2>
 * <HR>
 *
 * The standard states are on the unit molality basis. Therefore, in the
 * documentation below, the normal \f$ o \f$ superscript is replaced with
 * the \f$ \triangle \f$ symbol. The reference state symbol is now
 *  \f$ \triangle, ref \f$.
 *
 *
 *  It is assumed that the reference state thermodynamics may be
 *  obtained by a pointer to a populated species thermodynamic property
 *  manager class (see ThermoPhase::m_spthermo). How to relate pressure
 *  changes to the reference state thermodynamics is resolved at this level.
 *
 *  For an incompressible,
 * stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties
 * are specified by giving the standard-state enthalpy, the
 * term \f$ P_0 \hat v\f$ is subtracted from the specified molar
 * enthalpy to compute the molar internal energy. The entropy is
 * assumed to be independent of the pressure.
 *
 * The enthalpy function is given by the following relation.
 *
 *       \f[
 *         h^\triangle_k(T,P) = h^{\triangle,ref}_k(T)
 *         + \tilde v \left( P - P_{ref} \right)
 *       \f]
 *
 * For an incompressible,
 * stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties
 * are specified by giving the standard-state enthalpy, the
 * term \f$ P_{ref} \tilde v\f$ is subtracted from the specified reference molar
 * enthalpy to compute the molar internal energy.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            u^\triangle_k(T,P) = h^{\triangle,ref}_k(T) - P_{ref} \tilde v
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard state heat capacity and entropy are independent
 * of pressure. The standard state gibbs free energy is obtained
 * from the enthalpy and entropy functions.
 *
 * The vector Phase::m_speciesSize[] is used to hold the
 * base values of species sizes. These are defined as the
 * molar volumes of species at infinite dilution at 300 K and 1 atm
 * of water. m_speciesSize are calculated during the initialization of the
 * %DebyeHuckel object and are then not touched.
 *
 * The current model assumes that an incompressible molar volume for
 * all solutes. The molar volume for the water solvent, however,
 * is obtained from a pure water equation of state, waterSS.
 * Therefore, the water standard state varies with both T and P.
 * It is an error to request standard state water properties  at a T and P
 * where the water phase is not a stable phase, i.e., beyond its
 * spinodal curve.
 *
 * <HR>
 * <H2> Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties </H2>
 * <HR>
 *
 * Chemical potentials
 * of the solutes,  \f$ \mu_k \f$, and the solvent, \f$ \mu_o \f$, which are based
 * on the molality form, have the following general format:
 *
 * \f[
 *    \mu_k = \mu^{\triangle}_k(T,P) + R T ln(\gamma_k^{\triangle} \frac{m_k}{m^\triangle})
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *    \mu_o = \mu^o_o(T,P) + RT ln(a_o)
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$ \gamma_k^{\triangle} \f$ is the molality based activity coefficient for species
 * \f$k\f$.
 *
 * Individual activity coefficients of ions can not be independently measured. Instead,
 * only binary pairs forming electroneutral solutions can be measured.

 *
 *  <H3> Ionic Strength </H3>
 *
 *  Most of the parameterizations within the model use the ionic strength
 *  as a key variable. The ionic strength, \f$ I\f$ is defined as follows
 *
 *  \f[
 *    I = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k{m_k  z_k^2}
 *  \f]
 *
 * \f$ m_k \f$ is the molality of the kth species. \f$ z_k \f$ is the charge
 * of the kth species. Note, the ionic strength is a defined units quantity.
 * The molality has defined units of gmol kg-1, and therefore the ionic
 * strength has units of sqrt( gmol kg-1).
 *
 * In some instances, from some authors, a different
 * formulation is used for the ionic strength in the equations below. The different
 * formulation is due to the possibility of the existence of weak acids and how
 * association wrt to the weak acid equilibrium relation affects the calculation
 * of the activity coefficients via the assumed value of the ionic strength.
 *
 * If we are to assume that the association reaction doesn't have an effect
 * on the ionic strength, then we will want to consider the associated weak
 * acid as in effect being fully dissociated, when we calculate an effective
 * value for the ionic strength. We will call this calculated value, the
 * stoichiometric ionic strength, \f$ I_s \f$, putting a subscript s to denote
 * it from the more straightforward calculation of \f$ I \f$.
 *
 *  \f[
 *    I_s = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k{m_k^s  z_k^2}
 *  \f]
 *
 *  Here, \f$ m_k^s \f$ is the value of the molalities calculated assuming that
 *  all weak acid-base pairs are in their fully dissociated states. This calculation may
 * be simplified by considering that the weakly associated acid may be made up of two
 * charged species, k1 and k2, each with their own charges, obeying the following relationship:
 *
 *   \f[
 *      z_k = z_{k1} +  z_{k2}
 *   \f]
 *  Then, we may only need to specify one charge value, say, \f$  z_{k1}\f$,
 *  the cation charge number,
 *  in order to get both numbers, since we have already specified \f$ z_k \f$
 *  in the definition of original species.
 *  Then, the stoichiometric ionic strength may be calculated via the following formula.
 *
 *  \f[
 *    I_s = \frac{1}{2} \left(\sum_{k,ions}{m_k  z_k^2}+
 *               \sum_{k,weak_assoc}(m_k  z_{k1}^2 + m_k  z_{k2}^2) \right)
 *  \f]
 *
 *  The specification of which species are weakly associated acids is made in the input
 *  file via the
 *  <TT> stoichIsMods </TT> XML block, where the charge for k1 is also specified.
 *  An example is given below:
 *
 * @code
 *          <stoichIsMods>
 *                NaCl(aq):-1.0
 *          </stoichIsMods>
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Because we need the concept of a weakly associated acid in order to calculated
 *  \f$ I_s \f$ we need to
 *  catalog all species in the phase. This is done using the following categories:
 *
 *  -  <B>cEST_solvent</B>                Solvent species (neutral)
 *  -  <B>cEST_chargedSpecies</B>         Charged species (charged)
 *  -  <B>cEST_weakAcidAssociated</B>     Species which can break apart into charged species.
 *                                        It may or may not be charged.  These may or
 *                                        may not be be included in the
 *                                        species solution vector.
 *  -  <B>cEST_strongAcidAssociated</B>   Species which always breaks apart into charged species.
 *                                        It may or may not be charged. Normally, these aren't included
 *                                        in the speciation vector.
 *  -  <B>cEST_polarNeutral </B>          Polar neutral species
 *  -  <B>cEST_nonpolarNeutral</B>        Non polar neutral species
 *
 *  Polar and non-polar neutral species are differentiated, because some additions
 *  to the activity
 *  coefficient expressions distinguish between these two types of solutes. This is the so-called
 *  salt-out effect.
 *
 * The type of species is specified in the <TT>electrolyteSpeciesType</TT> XML block.
 * Note, this is not
 * considered a part of the specification of the standard state for the species,
 * at this time. Therefore,
 * this information is put under the <TT>activityCoefficient</TT> XML block. An example
 * is given below
 *
 * @code
 *         <electrolyteSpeciesType>
 *                H2L(L):solvent
 *                H+:chargedSpecies
 *                NaOH(aq):weakAcidAssociated
 *                NaCl(aq):strongAcidAssociated
 *                NH3(aq):polarNeutral
 *                O2(aq):nonpolarNeutral
 *         </electrolyteSpeciesType>
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Much of the species electrolyte type information is inferred from other information in the
 *  input file. For example, as species which is charged is given the "chargedSpecies" default
 *  category. A neutral solute species is put into the "nonpolarNeutral" category by default.
 *
 * The specification of solute activity coefficients depends on the model
 * assumed for the Debye-Huckel term. The model is set by the
 * internal parameter #m_formDH. We will now describe each category in its own section.
 *
 *
 *  <H3> Debye-Huckel Dilute Limit </H3>
 *
 *  DHFORM_DILUTE_LIMIT = 0
 *
 *  This form assumes a dilute limit to DH, and is mainly for informational purposes:
 *  \f[
 *      \ln(\gamma_k^\triangle) = - z_k^2 A_{Debye} \sqrt{I}
 *  \f]
 *              where \f$ I\f$ is the ionic strength
 *  \f[
 *    I = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k{m_k  z_k^2}
 *  \f]
 *
 *  The activity for the solvent water,\f$ a_o \f$, is not independent and must be
 *  determined from the Gibbs-Duhem relation.
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \ln(a_o) = \frac{X_o - 1.0}{X_o} + \frac{ 2 A_{Debye} \tilde{M}_o}{3} (I)^{3/2}
 *  \f]
 *
 *
 *  <H3> Bdot Formulation </H3>
 *
 *    DHFORM_BDOT_AK       = 1
 *
 *      This form assumes Bethke's format for the Debye Huckel activity coefficient:
 *
 *   \f[
 *      \ln(\gamma_k^\triangle) = -z_k^2 \frac{A_{Debye} \sqrt{I}}{ 1 + B_{Debye}  a_k \sqrt{I}}
 *                        + \log(10) B^{dot}_k  I
 *   \f]
 *
 *  Note, this particular form where \f$ a_k \f$ can differ in multielectrolyte
 *  solutions has problems with respect to a Gibbs-Duhem analysis. However,
 *  we include it here because there is a lot of data fit to it.
 *
 *  The activity for the solvent water,\f$ a_o \f$, is not independent and must be
 *  determined from the Gibbs-Duhem relation. Here, we use:
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \ln(a_o) = \frac{X_o - 1.0}{X_o}
 *        + \frac{ 2 A_{Debye} \tilde{M}_o}{3} (I)^{1/2}
 *                        \left[ \sum_k{\frac{1}{2} m_k z_k^2 \sigma( B_{Debye} a_k \sqrt{I} ) } \right]
 *                        - \frac{\log(10)}{2} \tilde{M}_o I \sum_k{ B^{dot}_k m_k}
 *  \f]
 *    where
 *  \f[
 *     \sigma (y) = \frac{3}{y^3} \left[ (1+y) - 2 \ln(1 + y) - \frac{1}{1+y} \right]
 *  \f]
 *
 * Additionally, Helgeson's formulation for the water activity is offered as an
 * alternative.
 *
 *
 *  <H3> Bdot Formulation with Uniform Size Parameter in the Denominator </H3>
 *
 *  DHFORM_BDOT_AUNIFORM = 2
 *
 *  This form assumes Bethke's format for the Debye-Huckel activity coefficient
 *
 *   \f[
 *    \ln(\gamma_k^\triangle) = -z_k^2 \frac{A_{Debye} \sqrt{I}}{ 1 + B_{Debye}  a \sqrt{I}}
 *                        + \log(10) B^{dot}_k  I
 *   \f]
 *
 *  The value of a is determined at the beginning of the calculation, and not changed.
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \ln(a_o) = \frac{X_o - 1.0}{X_o}
 *        + \frac{ 2 A_{Debye} \tilde{M}_o}{3} (I)^{3/2} \sigma( B_{Debye} a \sqrt{I} )
 *                        - \frac{\log(10)}{2} \tilde{M}_o I \sum_k{ B^{dot}_k m_k}
 *  \f]
 *
 *
 *  <H3> Beta_IJ formulation </H3>
 *
 *  DHFORM_BETAIJ        = 3
 *
 *  This form assumes a linear expansion in a virial coefficient form.
 *  It is used extensively in the book by Newmann, "Electrochemistry Systems",
 *  and is the beginning of more complex treatments for stronger electrolytes,
 *  fom Pitzer and from Harvey, Moller, and Weire.
 *
 *   \f[
 *    \ln(\gamma_k^\triangle) = -z_k^2 \frac{A_{Debye} \sqrt{I}}{ 1 + B_{Debye}  a \sqrt{I}}
 *                         + 2 \sum_j \beta_{j,k} m_j
 *   \f]
 *
 *  In the current treatment the binary interaction coefficients, \f$ \beta_{j,k}\f$, are
 *  independent of temperature and pressure.
 *
 *  \f[
 *       \ln(a_o) = \frac{X_o - 1.0}{X_o}

 *
 * In this formulation the ionic radius, \f$ a \f$, is a constant. This must be supplied to the

 *
 *  In the equations above, the formulas for  \f$  A_{Debye} \f$ and \f$  B_{Debye} \f$
 *  are needed. The %DebyeHuckel object uses two methods for specifying these quantities.
 *  The default method is to assume that \f$  A_{Debye} \f$  is a constant, given
 *  in the initialization process, and stored in the
 *  member double, m_A_Debye. Optionally, a full water treatment may be employed that makes
 *  \f$ A_{Debye} \f$ a full function of <I>T</I> and <I>P</I>.
 *

 * where
 *
 *  \f[

 * For the time being, we have set the standard concentration for all species in

 * This means that the
 * kinetics operator essentially works on an activities basis, with units specified
 * as if it were on a concentration basis.
 *
 * For example, a bulk-phase binary reaction between liquid species j and k, producing
 * a new liquid species l would have the

 * units of kmol m-3 s-1.

 *      C_j^a = C_o a_j \quad and \quad C_k^a = C_o a_k
 *   \f]
 *
 *  \f$ C_j^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species j, and
 *  \f$ C_k^a \f$ is the activity concentration of species k. \f$ C_o \f$
 *  is the concentration of water at 298 K and 1 atm. \f$ a_j \f$ is
 *  the activity of species j at the current temperature and pressure
 *  and concentration of the liquid phase. \f$k^1 \f$ has units of m3 kmol-1 s-1.
 *
 *  The reverse rate constant can then be obtained from the law of microscopic reversibility
 * and the equilibrium expression for the system.
 *
 *   \f[
