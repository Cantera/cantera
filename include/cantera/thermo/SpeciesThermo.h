/**
 * @defgroup mgrsrefcalc Managers for Calculating Reference-State Thermodynamics
 *
 *  The ThermoPhase object relies on a set of manager classes to calculate
 *  the thermodynamic properties of the reference state for all
 *  of the species in the phase. This may be a computationally
 *  significant cost, so efficiency is important.
 *  This group describes how this is done efficiently within Cantera.
 *
 * To compute the thermodynamic properties of multicomponent
 * solutions, it is necessary to know something about the
 * thermodynamic properties of the individual species present in
 * the solution. Exactly what sort of species properties are
 * required depends on the thermodynamic model for the
 * solution. For a gaseous solution (i.e., a gas mixture), the
 * species properties required are usually ideal gas properties at
 * the mixture temperature and at a reference pressure (almost always at
 * 1 bar).
 *
 * In defining these standard states for species in a phase, we make
 * the following definition. A reference state is a standard state
 * of a species in a phase limited to one particular pressure, the reference
 * pressure. The reference state specifies the dependence of all
 * thermodynamic functions as a function of the temperature, in
 * between a minimum temperature and a maximum temperature. The
 * reference state also specifies the molar volume of the species
 * as a function of temperature. The molar volume is a thermodynamic
 * function. By contrast, a full standard state does the same thing
 * as a reference state, but specifies the thermodynamics functions
 * at all pressures.
 *
 *  Whatever the conventions used by a particular solution model,
 *  means need to be provided to compute the species properties in
 *  the reference state. Class SpeciesThermo is the base class
 *  for a family of classes that compute properties of all
 *  species in a phase in their reference states, for a range of temperatures.
 *  Note, the pressure dependence of the species thermodynamic functions is not
 *  handled by this particular species thermodynamic model. %SpeciesThermo
 *  calculates the reference-state thermodynamic values of all species in a single
 *  phase during each call. The vector nature of the operation leads to
 *  a lower operation count and better efficiency, especially if the
 *  individual reference state classes are known to the reference-state
 *  manager class so that common operations may be grouped together.
 *
 *  The most important member function for the %SpeciesThermo class
 *  is the member function \link SpeciesThermo::update() update()\endlink.
 *  The function calculates the values of Cp, H, and S for all of the
 *  species at once at the specified temperature.
 *
 *  Usually, all of the species in a phase are installed into a %SpeciesThermo
 *  class. However, there is no requirement that a %SpeciesThermo
 *  object handles all of the species in a phase. There are
 *  two member functions that are called to install each species into
 *  the %SpeciesThermo.
 *  One routine is called \link SpeciesThermo::install() install()\endlink.
 *  It is called with the index of the species in the phase,
 *  an integer type delineating
 *  the SpeciesThermoInterpType object, and a listing of the
 *  parameters for that parameterization. A factory routine is called based
 *  on the integer type.  The other routine is called
 *  \link SpeciesThermo::install_STIT() install_STIT()\endlink.
 *  It accepts as an argument a pointer to an already formed
 *  SpeciesThermoInterpType object.
 *
 *  The following classes inherit from %SpeciesThermo. Each of these classes
 *  handle multiple species, usually all of the species in a phase. However,
 *  there is no requirement that a %SpeciesThermo object handles all of the
 *  species in a phase.
 *
 *   - NasaThermo          in file NasaThermo.h
 *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
 *   - ShomateThermo       in file ShomateThermo.h
 *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Shomate Polynomial format.
 *   - SimpleThermo        in file SimpleThermo.h
 *      - This is a one-zone constant heat capacity model.
 *   - GeneralSpeciesThermo in file GeneralSpeciesThermo.h
 *      - This is a general model. Each species is handled separately
 *        via a vector over SpeciesThermoInterpType classes.
 *   - SpeciesThermoDuo      in file SpeciesThermoMgr.h
 *      - This is a combination of two SpeciesThermo types.
 *
 * The class SpeciesThermoInterpType is a pure virtual base class for
 * calculation of thermodynamic functions for a single species
 * in its reference state.
 * The following classes inherit from %SpeciesThermoInterpType.
 *
 *   - NasaPoly1          in file NasaPoly1.h
 *      - This is a one zone model,  consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
 *   - NasaPoly2          in file NasaPoly2.h
 *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
 *   - ShomatePoly        in file ShomatePoly.h
 *      - This is a one zone model, consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Shomate Polynomial format.
 *   - ShomatePoly2       in file ShomatePoly.h
 *      - This is a two zone model, with each zone consisting of a 7
 *        coefficient Shomate Polynomial format.
 *   - ConstCpPoly        in file ConstCpPoly.h
 *      - This is a one-zone constant heat capacity model.
 *   - Mu0Poly            in file Mu0Poly.h
 *      - This is a multizoned model. The chemical potential is given
 *        at a set number of temperatures. Between each temperature
 *        the heat capacity is treated as a constant.
 *   - Nasa9Poly1          in file Nasa9Poly1.h
 *      - This is a one zone model,  consisting of the 9
 *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format.
 *   - Nasa9PolyMultiTempRegion       in file Nasa9PolyMultiTempRegion.h
 *      - This is a multiple zone model, consisting of the 9
 *        coefficient Nasa Polynomial format in each zone.
 *
 * In particular the NasaThermo %SpeciesThermo-derived model has been
 * optimized for execution speed. It's the main-stay of gas phase computations
 * involving large numbers of species in a phase. It combines the calculation
 * of each species, which individually have NasaPoly2 representations, to
 * minimize the computational time.
 *
 * The GeneralSpeciesThermo %SpeciesThermo object is completely general. It
 * does not try to coordinate the individual species calculations at all and
 * therefore is the slowest but most general implementation.
