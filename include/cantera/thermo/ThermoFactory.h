//! Import a phase information into an empty thermophase object
/*!
 *   Here we read an XML description of the thermodynamic information
 *   for a phase. At the end of this routine, the phase should
 *   be ready to be used within applications. This routine contains
 *   some key routines that are used as pass back routines so that
 *   the phase (and the contents of the XML file) may contain
 *   variable parameterizations for the specification of the
 *   species standard states, the equation of state, and the
 *   specification of other nonidealities. Below, a description
 *   is presented of the main algorithm for bringing up a %ThermoPhase
 *   object, with care to present points where customizations
 *   occur.
 *
 *   Before invoking this routine, either the ThermoPhase Factory routines
 *   are called or direct constructor routines are called that
 *   instantiate an inherited ThermoPhase object. This object is input
 *   to this routine, and therefore contains inherited routines that
 *   drive the customization of the initialization process.
 *
 *   At the start of the routine, we import descriptions of the elements
 *   that make up the species in a phase.
 *
 *   We call setParametersFromXML(eos) to read parameters about
 *   the thermo phase before the species are read in.
 *
 *   We call addElementsFromXML() to add elements into the
 *   description of the phase.
 *
 *   We create a new species thermo manager.  Function
 *   'newSpeciesThermoMgr' looks at the species in the database
 *   to see what thermodynamic property parameterizations are
 *   used, and selects a class that can handle the
 *   parameterizations found.
 *
 *   We import information about the species, including their
 *   reference state thermodynamic polynomials. We then freeze
 *   the state of the species in the element.
 *
 *   Finally, we call initThermoXML(),
 *   a member function of the ThermoPhase object, to "finish"
 *   the description. Now that the species are known,
 *   additional information may be read in about the thermodynamics
 *   of the phase, (e.g.,  virial coefficients, which are
 *   binary or ternary interaction parameters between species).
 *
 * @param phase This object must be the phase node of a
 *             complete XML tree
 *             description of the phase, including all of the
 *             species data. In other words while "phase" must
 *             point to an XML phase object, it must have
 *             sibling nodes "speciesData" that describe
 *             the species in the phase.
 * @param th   Pointer to the ThermoPhase object which will
 *             handle the thermodynamics for this phase.
 *             We initialize part of the Thermophase object
 *             here, especially for those objects which are
 *             part of the Cantera Kernel.
 *
 * @param spfactory species Thermo factory pointer, if
 *                  available. If not available, one will be
 *                  created.

 *  This routine first gathers the information from the Species XML
