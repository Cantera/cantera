//! Import a phase information into an empty ThermoPhase object
/*!
 * Here we read an XML description of the thermodynamic information for a phase.
 * At the end of this routine, the phase should be ready to be used within
 * applications. This routine contains some key routines that are used as pass
 * back routines so that the phase (and the contents of the XML file) may
 * contain variable parameterizations for the specification of the species
 * standard states, the equation of state, and the specification of other
 * nonidealities. Below, a description is presented of the main algorithm for
 * bringing up a ThermoPhase object, with care to present points where
 * customizations occur.
 *
 * Before invoking this routine, either the ThermoPhase Factory routines are
 * called or direct constructor routines are called that instantiate an
 * inherited ThermoPhase object. This object is input to this routine, and
 * therefore contains inherited routines that drive the customization of the
 * initialization process.
 *
 * At the start of the routine, we import descriptions of the elements that make
 * up the species in a phase.
 *
 * We call setParametersFromXML(eos) to read parameters about the thermo phase
 * before the species are read in.
 *
 * We call addElementsFromXML() to add elements into the description of the
 * phase.
 *
 * We create a new species thermo manager. Function 'newSpeciesThermoMgr' looks
 * at the species in the database to see what thermodynamic property
 * parameterizations are used, and selects a class that can handle the
 * parameterizations found.
 *
 * We import information about the species, including their reference state
 * thermodynamic polynomials. We then freeze the state of the species in the
 * element.
 *
 * Finally, we call initThermoXML(), a member function of the ThermoPhase
 * object, to "finish" the description. Now that the species are known,
 * additional information may be read in about the thermodynamics of the phase,
 * (for example,  virial coefficients, which are binary or ternary interaction
 * parameters between species).
 *
 * @param phase This object must be the phase node of a complete XML tree
 *              description of the phase, including all of the species data. In
 *              other words while "phase" must point to an XML phase object, it
 *              must have sibling nodes "speciesData" that describe the species
 *              in the phase.
 * @param th    Pointer to the ThermoPhase object which will handle the
 *              thermodynamics for this phase. We initialize part of the
 *              ThermoPhase object here, especially for those objects which are
 *              part of the Cantera Kernel.
