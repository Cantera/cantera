/**
 * @ingroup thermoprops
 *
 * This is a filter class for ThermoPhase that implements some preparatory steps
 * for efficiently handling a variable pressure standard state for species.
 *
 * Several concepts are introduced. The first concept is there are temporary
 * variables for holding the species standard state values of Cp, H, S, G, and V
 * at the last temperature and pressure called. These functions are not
 * recalculated if a new call is made using the previous temperature and
 * pressure.
 *
 * To support the above functionality, pressure and temperature variables,
 * m_Plast_ss and m_Tlast_ss, are kept which store the last pressure and
 * temperature used in the evaluation of standard state properties.
 *
 * This class is usually used for nearly incompressible phases. For those
 * phases, it makes sense to change the equation of state independent variable
 * from density to pressure. The variable m_Pcurrent contains the current value
 * of the pressure within the phase.
