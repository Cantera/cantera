//! Class StoichSubstance represents a stoichiometric (fixed composition)
//! incompressible substance.
/*!
 * This class internally changes the independent degree of freedom from density
 * to pressure. This is necessary because the phase is incompressible. It uses a
 * constant volume approximation.
 *
 * ## Specification of Species Standard State Properties
 *
 * This class inherits from SingleSpeciesTP. It is assumed that the reference
 * state thermodynamics may be obtained by a pointer to a populated species
 * thermodynamic property manager class (see ThermoPhase::m_spthermo). How to
 * relate pressure changes to the reference state thermodynamics is resolved at
 * this level.
 *
 * For an incompressible, stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties are specified by
 * giving the standard-state enthalpy, the term \f$ P_0 \hat v\f$ is subtracted
 * from the specified molar enthalpy to compute the molar internal energy. The
 * entropy is assumed to be independent of the pressure.
 *
 * The enthalpy function is given by the following relation.
 *
 *       \f[
 *              h^o_k(T,P) =
 *                  h^{ref}_k(T) + \tilde v \left( P - P_{ref} \right)
 *       \f]
 *
 * For an incompressible, stoichiometric substance, the molar internal energy is
 * independent of pressure. Since the thermodynamic properties are specified by
 * giving the standard-state enthalpy, the term \f$ P_{ref} \tilde v\f$ is
 * subtracted from the specified reference molar enthalpy to compute the molar
 * internal energy.
 *
 *       \f[
 *            u^o_k(T,P) = h^{ref}_k(T) - P_{ref} \tilde v
 *       \f]
 *
 * The standard state heat capacity and entropy are independent of pressure. The
 * standard state Gibbs free energy is obtained from the enthalpy and entropy
 * functions.
 *
 * ## Specification of Solution Thermodynamic Properties
 *
 * All solution properties are obtained from the standard state species
 * functions, since there is only one species in the phase.
 *
 * ## Application within Kinetics Managers
 *
 * The standard concentration is equal to 1.0. This means that the kinetics
 * operator works on an (activities basis). Since this is a stoichiometric
 * substance, this means that the concentration of this phase drops out of
 * kinetics expressions.
 *
 * An example of a reaction using this is a sticking coefficient reaction of a
 * substance in an ideal gas phase on a surface with a bulk phase species in
 * this phase. In this case, the rate of progress for this reaction,
 * \f$ R_s \f$, may be expressed via the following equation:
 *   \f[
 *    R_s = k_s C_{gas}
 *   \f]
 * where the units for \f$ R_s \f$ are kmol m-2 s-1. \f$ C_{gas} \f$ has units
 * of kmol m-3. Therefore, the kinetic rate constant, \f$ k_s \f$, has units of
 * m s-1. Nowhere does the concentration of the bulk phase appear in the rate
 * constant expression, since it's a stoichiometric phase and the activity is
 * always equal to 1.0.
