/**
 * @ingroup thermoprops
 *
 *  This is a filter class for ThermoPhase that implements some preparatory
 *  steps for efficiently handling mixture of gases that whose standard states
 *  are defined as ideal gases, but which describe also non-ideal solutions.
 *  In addition a multicomponent liquid phase below the critical temperature of the
 *  mixture is also allowed. The main subclass is currently a mixture Redlich-Kwong class.
 *
 *  Several concepts are introduced. The first concept is there are temporary
 *  variables for holding the species standard state values
 *  of Cp, H, S, G, and V at the last temperature and pressure called. These functions are not recalculated
 *  if a new call is made using the previous temperature and pressure.
 *
 *  The other concept is that the current state of the mixture is tracked.
 *  The state variable is either GAS, LIQUID, or SUPERCRIT fluid.  Additionally,
 *  the variable LiquidContent is used and may vary between 0 and 1.
 *
 *  To support the above functionality, pressure and temperature variables,
 *  m_Plast_ss and m_Tlast_ss, are kept which store the last pressure and temperature
 *  used in the evaluation of standard state properties.
 *
 *  Typically, only one liquid phase is allowed to be formed within these classes.
 *  Additionally, there is an inherent contradiction between three phase models and
 *  the ThermoPhase class. The ThermoPhase class is really only meant to represent a
 *  single instantiation of a phase. The three phase models may be in equilibrium with
 *  multiple phases of the fluid in equilibrium with each other. This has yet to be resolved.
 *
 *  This class is usually used for non-ideal gases.
