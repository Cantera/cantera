/**

 *
 * <H3> Treatment of the %Phase Potential and the electrochemical potential of
 * a species </H3>
 *
 * The electrochemical potential of species *k* in a phase *p*, \f$ \zeta_k \f$,
 * is related to the chemical potential via the following equation,
 *
 *       \f[
 *            \zeta_{k}(T,P) = \mu_{k}(T,P) + z_k \phi_p
 *       \f]
 *
 * where  \f$ \nu_k \f$ is the charge of species *k*, and \f$ \phi_p \f$ is
 * the electric potential of phase *p*.
 *
 * The potential  \f$ \phi_p \f$ is tracked and internally stored within the
 * base ThermoPhase object. It constitutes a specification of the internal
 * state of the phase; it's the third state variable, the first two being
 * temperature and density (or, pressure, for incompressible equations of
 * state). It may be set with the function,
 * ThermoPhase::setElectricPotential(), and may be queried with the function
 * ThermoPhase::electricPotential().
 *
 * Note, the overall electrochemical potential of a phase may not be changed
 * by the potential because many phases enforce charge neutrality:
 *
 *       \f[
 *            0 = \sum_k z_k X_k
 *       \f]
 *
 * Whether charge neutrality is necessary for a phase is also specified within
 * the ThermoPhase object, by the function call
 * ThermoPhase::chargeNeutralityNecessary(). Note, that it is not necessary
 * for the IdealGas phase, currently. However, it is necessary for liquid
 * phases such as Cantera::DebyeHuckel and Cantera::HMWSoln for the proper
 * specification of the chemical potentials.
 *
 * This equation, when applied to the \f$ \zeta_k \f$ equation described
 * above, results in a zero net change in the effective Gibbs free energy of
 * the phase. However, specific charged species in the phase may increase or
 * decrease their electrochemical potentials, which will have an effect on
 * interfacial reactions involving charged species, when there is a potential
 * drop between phases. This effect is used within the
 * Cantera::InterfaceKinetics and Cantera::EdgeKinetics kinetics objects
 * classes.
 *
 * <H3> Electrothermochemical Properties of Phases of Matter. </H3>
 *
 * The following classes are used to compute the electrical and
 * electrothermochemical properties of phases of matter. The main property
 * currently is the dielectric constant, which is an important parameter for
 * electrolyte solutions. The class WaterProps calculate the dielectric
 * constant of water as a function of temperature and pressure.
 *
 * WaterProps also calculate the constant A_debye used in the Debye Huckel and
 * Pitzer activity coefficient calculations.
