//! Advances the surface coverages of the associated set of SurfacePhase
//! objects in time
/*!
 * This function advances a set of SurfPhase objects, each associated with one
 * InterfaceKinetics object, in time. The following equation is used for each
 * surface phase, *i*.
 *
 *   \f[
 *        \dot \theta_k = \dot s_k (\sigma_k / s_0)
 *   \f]
 *
 * In this equation,
 * - \f$ \theta_k \f$ is the site coverage for the kth species.
 * - \f$ \dot s_k \f$ is the source term for the kth species
 * - \f$ \sigma_k \f$ is the number of surface sites covered by each species k.
 * - \f$ s_0 \f$ is the total site density of the interfacial phase.
 *
 * Additionally, the 0'th equation in the set is discarded. Instead the
 * alternate equation is solved for
 *
 * \f[
 *     \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}  \dot \theta_k = 0
 * \f]
 *
 * This last equation serves to ensure that sum of the \f$ \theta_k \f$ values
 * stays constant.
 *
 * The object uses the CVODE software to advance the surface equations.
 *
 * The solution vector used by this object is as follows: For each surface
 * phase with \f$ N_s \f$ surface sites, it consists of the surface coverages
 * \f$ \theta_k \f$ for \f$ k = 0, N_s - 1 \f$
