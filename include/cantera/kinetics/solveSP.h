//! Method to solve a pseudo steady state surface problem
/*!
 *  The following class handles solving the surface problem. The calculation
 *  uses Newton's method to obtain the surface fractions of the surface and
 *  bulk species by requiring that the surface species production rate = 0 and
 *  that the either the bulk fractions are proportional to their production
 *  rates or they are constants.
 *
 *  Currently, the bulk mole fractions are treated as constants.
 *  Implementation of their being added to the unknown solution vector is
 *  delayed.
 *
 *  Lets introduce the unknown vector for the "surface problem". The surface
 *  problem is defined as the evaluation of the surface site fractions for
 *  multiple surface phases. The unknown vector will consist of the vector of
 *  surface concentrations for each species in each surface vector. Species
 *  are grouped first by their surface phases
 *
 *  - C_i_j = Concentration of the ith species in the jth surface phase
 *  - Nj = number of surface species in the jth surface phase
 *
 *  The unknown solution vector is defined as follows:
 *
 *  C_i_j     | kindexSP
 *  --------- | ----------
 *  C_0_0     |   0
 *  C_1_0     |   1
 *  C_2_0     |   2
 *   . . .    |  ...
 *  C_N0-1_0  | N0-1
 *  C_0_1     | N0
 *  C_1_1     | N0+1
 *  C_2_1     | N0+2
 *   . . .    | ...
 *  C_N1-1_1  | NO+N1-1
 *
 *  Note there are a couple of different types of species indices floating
 *  around in the formulation of this object.
 *
 *  kindexSP: This is the species index in the contiguous vector of unknowns
 *            for the surface problem.
 *
 *  Note, in the future, BULK_DEPOSITION systems will be added, and the
 *  solveSP unknown vector will get more complicated. It will include the mole
 *  fraction and growth rates of specified bulk phases
 *
 *  Indices which relate to individual kinetics objects use the suffix KSI
 *  (kinetics species index).
 *
 *  ## Solution Method
 *
 *  This routine is typically used within a residual calculation in a large code.
 *  It's typically invoked millions of times for large calculations, and it must
 *  work every time. Therefore, requirements demand that it be robust but also
 *  efficient.
 *
 *  The solution methodology is largely determined by the `ifunc` parameter,
 *  that is input to the solution object. This parameter may have one of the
 *  values defined in @ref solvesp_methods.
 *
 *  ### Pseudo time stepping algorithm:
 *  The time step is determined from sdot[], so  so that the time step
 *  doesn't ever change the value of a variable by more than 100%.
 *
 *  This algorithm does use a damped Newton's method to relax the equations.
 *  Damping is based on a "delta damping" technique. The solution unknowns
 *  are not allowed to vary too much between iterations.
 *
 *  `EXTRA_ACCURACY`: A constant that is the ratio of the required update norm
 *  in this Newton iteration compared to that in the nonlinear solver. A value
 *  of 0.1 is used so surface species are safely  overconverged.
 *
 *  Functions called:
 *  - `ct_dgetrf` -- First half of LAPACK direct solve of a full Matrix
 *  - `ct_dgetrs` -- Second half of LAPACK direct solve of a full matrix.
 *    Returns solution vector in the right-hand-side vector, resid.
