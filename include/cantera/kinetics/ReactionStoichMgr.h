/**
 * Reaction mechanism stoichiometry manager. This is an internal class used
 * by kinetics manager classes, and is not meant for direct use in
 * user programs.
 *
 * Class ReactionStoichMgr handles the calculation of quantities involving
 * the stoichiometry of a set of reactions. The reactions may have integer
 * or non-integer stoichiometric coefficients. Specifically, its methods compute
 * - species creation rates
 * - species destruction rates
 * - species net production rates
 * - the change in molar species properties in the reactions
 * - concentration products
 *
 * To use this class, method add() is first used to add each reaction.
 * Once all reactions have been added, the methods that compute various
 * quantities may be called.
 *
 * The nomenclature used below to document the methods is as follows.
 *
 * - \f$ N_r \f$
 *     Integer reactant stoichiometric coefficient matrix. The (k,i)
 *     element of this matrix is the stoichiometric coefficient of
 *     species \e k as a reactant in reaction \e i.
 * - \f$ N_p \f$
 *     Integer product stoichiometric coefficient matrix. The (k,i)
 *     element of this matrix is the stoichiometric coefficient of
 *     species \e k as a product in reaction \e i.
 * - \f$ Q_{\rm fwd} \f$
 *     Vector of length I of forward rates of progress.
 * - \f$ Q_{\rm rev} \f$
 *     Vector of length I of reverse rates of progress.
 * - \f$ C \f$
 *     Vector of K species creation rates.
 * - \f$ D \f$
 *     Vector of K species destruction rates.
 * - \f$ W = C - D \f$
 *     Vector of K species net production rates.
