//!  A kinetics manager for heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. The
//!  reactions are assumed to occur at a 2D interface between two 3D phases.
/*!
 *  There are some important additions to the behavior of the kinetics class
 *  due to the presence of multiple phases and a heterogeneous interface.  If
 *  a reactant phase doesn't exists, i.e., has a mole number of zero, a
 *  heterogeneous reaction can not proceed from reactants to products. Note it
 *  could perhaps proceed from products to reactants if all of the product
 *  phases exist.
 *
 *  In order to make the determination of whether a phase exists or not
 *  actually involves the specification of additional information to the
 *  kinetics object., which heretofore has only had access to intrinsic field
 *  information about the phases (i.e., temperature pressure, and mole
 *  fraction).
 *
 *  The extrinsic specification of whether a phase exists or not  must be
 *  specified on top of the intrinsic calculation of the reaction rate.  This
 *  class carries a set of booleans indicating whether a phase in the
 *  heterogeneous mechanism exists or not.
 *
 *  Additionally, the class carries a set of booleans around indicating
 *  whether a product phase is stable or not. If a phase is not
 *  thermodynamically stable, it may be the case that a particular reaction in
 *  a heterogeneous mechanism will create a product species in the unstable
 *  phase. However, other reactions in the mechanism will destruct that
 *  species. This may cause oscillations in the formation of the unstable
 *  phase from time step to time step within a ODE solver, in practice. In
 *  order to avoid this situation, a set of booleans is tracked which sets the
 *  stability of a phase. If a phase is deemed to be unstable, then species in
 *  that phase will not be allowed to be birthed by the kinetics operator.
 *  Nonexistent phases are deemed to be unstable by default, but this can be
 *  changed.
