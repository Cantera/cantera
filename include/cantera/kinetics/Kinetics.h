/// @defgroup kineticsmgr Kinetics Managers
/// @section kinmodman Models and Managers
///
/// A kinetics manager is a C++ class that implements a kinetics model; a
/// kinetics model is a set of mathematical equation describing how various
/// kinetic quantities are to be computed -- reaction rates, species production
/// rates, etc. Many different kinetics models might be defined to handle
/// different types of kinetic processes. For example, one kinetics model might
/// use expressions valid for elementary reactions in ideal gas mixtures. It
/// might, for example, require the reaction orders to be integral and equal to
/// the forward stoichiometric coefficients, require that each reaction be
/// reversible with a reverse rate satisfying detailed balance, include
/// pressure-dependent unimolecular reactions, etc. Another kinetics model might
/// be designed for heterogeneous chemistry at interfaces, and might allow
/// empirical reaction orders, coverage-dependent activation energies,
/// irreversible reactions, and include effects of potential differences across
/// the interface on reaction rates.
///
/// A kinetics manager implements a kinetics model. Since the model equations
/// may be complex and expensive to evaluate, a kinetics manager may adopt
/// various strategies to 'manage' the computation and evaluate the expressions
/// efficiently. For example, if there are rate coefficients or other quantities
/// that depend only on temperature, a manager class may choose to store these
/// quantities internally, and re-evaluate them only when the temperature has
/// actually changed. Or a manager designed for use with reaction mechanisms
/// with a few repeated activation energies might precompute the terms \f$
/// exp(-E/RT) \f$, instead of evaluating the exponential repeatedly for each
/// reaction. There are many other possible 'management styles', each of which
/// might be better suited to some reaction mechanisms than others.
///
/// But however a manager structures the internal computation, the tasks the
/// manager class must perform are, for the most part, the same. It must be able
/// to compute reaction rates, species production rates, equilibrium constants,
/// etc. Therefore, all kinetics manager classes should have a common set of
/// public methods, but differ in how they implement these methods.
///
/// A kinetics manager computes reaction rates of progress, species production
/// rates, equilibrium constants, and similar quantities for a reaction
/// mechanism. All kinetics manager classes derive from class Kinetics, which
/// defines a common public interface for all kinetics managers. Each derived
/// class overloads the virtual methods of Kinetics to implement a particular
/// kinetics model.
///
/// For example, class GasKinetics implements reaction rate expressions
/// appropriate for homogeneous reactions in ideal gas mixtures, and class
/// InterfaceKinetics implements expressions appropriate for heterogeneous
/// mechanisms at interfaces, including how to handle reactions involving
/// charged species of phases with different electric potentials --- something
/// that class GasKinetics doesn't deal with at all.
///
/// Many of the methods of class Kinetics write into arrays the values of some
/// quantity for each species, for example the net production rate. These
/// methods always write the results into flat arrays, ordered by phase in the
/// order the phase was added, and within a phase in the order the species were
/// added to the phase (which is the same ordering as in the input file).
/// Example: suppose a heterogeneous mechanism involves three phases -- a bulk
/// phase 'a', another bulk phase 'b', and the surface phase 'a:b' at the a/b
/// interface. Phase 'a' contains 12 species, phase 'b' contains 3, and at the
/// interface there are 5 adsorbed species defined in phase 'a:b'. Then methods
/// like getNetProductionRates(doublereal* net) will write and output array of
/// length 20, beginning at the location pointed to by 'net'. The first 12
/// values will be the net production rates for all 12 species of phase 'a'
/// (even if some do not participate in the reactions), the next 3 will be for
/// phase 'b', and finally the net production rates for the surface species will
/// occupy the last 5 locations.
