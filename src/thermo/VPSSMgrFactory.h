 *  This class is responsible for making the decision concerning
 *  which derivative of VPSSMgr object to use.
 *  The VPSSMgr object is used to calculate
 *  thermodynamic functions for the standard state.
 *  It queries the database of species to understand what
 *  the requirements are for the submodels for all of the
 *  species in the phase. Then, it picks the derived VPSSMgr
 *  object to use and passes it back to the calling routine.
 *  It doesn't load any data into the derived
 *  VPSSMgr object.
 *
 *  Making the choice of VPSSMgr types is the only
 *  thing this class does.
 *
 * This class is implemented as a singleton -- one in which
 * only one instance is needed.  The recommended way to access
 * the factory is to call this static method, which
 * instantiates the class if it is the first call, but
 * otherwise simply returns the pointer to the existing
 * instance.
