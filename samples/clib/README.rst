C Examples
==========

These examples demonstrate the usage of Cantera's generated C interface library,
which can also be used to call Cantera from other languages that are able to call C
functions.

.. caution::
    The generated CLib interface is an experimental part of the Cantera API and may
    be changed or removed without notice.
