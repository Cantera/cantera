C (experimental) Examples
=========================

These examples demonstrate the usage of Cantera's C interface library, ``clib``,
which can also be used to call Cantera from other languages that are able to
call C functions.

.. caution::
    The CLib interface is an experimental part of the Cantera API and may be changed
    or removed without notice.
