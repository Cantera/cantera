C (experimental) Examples
=========================

These examples demonstrate the usage of Cantera's experimental C interface library,
``clib_experimental``, which can also be used to call Cantera from other languages that
are able to call C functions.

.. caution::
    The CLib interface is an experimental part of the Cantera API and may be changed
    or removed without notice.
