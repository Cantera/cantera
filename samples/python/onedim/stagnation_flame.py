A detached flat flame stabilized at a stagnation point

This script simulates a lean hydrogen-oxygen flame stabilized in a strained
flowfield at an axisymmetric stagnation point on a non-reacting surface. The
solution begins with a flame attached to the inlet (burner), and the mass flow
rate is progressively increased, causing the flame to detach and move closer
to the surface.

This example illustrates use of the new 'prune' grid refinement parameter,
which allows grid points to be removed if they are no longer required to
resolve the solution. This is important here, since the flamefront moves as
the mass flowrate is increased. Without using 'prune', a large number of grid
points would be concentrated upsteam of the flame, where the flamefront had
been previously. (To see this, try setting prune to zero.)
