"""
Solid oxide fuel cell using elementary kinetics
===============================================

A simple model of a solid oxide fuel cell.

Unlike most SOFC models, this model does not use semi-empirical Butler-Volmer
kinetics for the charge transfer reactions, but uses elementary, reversible
reactions obeying mass-action kinetics for all reactions, including charge
transfer. As this script will demonstrate, this approach allows computing the
OCV (it does not need to be separately specified), as well as polarization
curves.

.. caution::

    The parameters here, and in the input file ``sofc.yaml``, are not to be relied upon
    for a real SOFC simulation! They are meant to illustrate only how to do such a
    calculation in Cantera. While some of the parameters may be close to real values,
    others are simply set arbitrarily to give reasonable-looking results.

    It is recommended that you read input file ``sofc.yaml`` before reading or running
    this script.

Requires: cantera >= 2.6.0, scipy, pandas
