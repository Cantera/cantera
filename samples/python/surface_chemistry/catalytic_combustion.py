Catalytic combustion of methane on platinum

This script solves a catalytic combustion problem. A stagnation flow is set
up, with a gas inlet 10 cm from a platinum surface at 900 K. The lean,
premixed methane/air mixture enters at ~6 cm/s (0.06 kg/m2/s), and burns
catalytically on the platinum surface. Gas-phase chemistry is included too,
and has some effect very near the surface.

The catalytic combustion mechanism is from Deutschmann et al., 26th
Symp. (Intl.) on Combustion,1996 pp. 1747-1754

Requires: cantera >= 2.6.0
