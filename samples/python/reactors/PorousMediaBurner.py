Short description: reactor cascade model for reactive flows in inert porous media
based on extensible reactors. Showcases adding a temperature equation for a
solid-phase and custom heat transfer/radiation models.

Code by Thorsten Zirwes and Guillaume Vignat
Stanford University & Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)
2023

This code implements a reactor cascade model for the simulation of reactive
flows in porous media. The gas mixture with fuel and oxidizer flows through
the porous material and the chemical reactions take place inside the pore
cavities. The heat released by the chemical reactions heats up the solid materials.
This heat is then transported by conduction in the solid and radiation upstream
to heat up the reactants and stabilize the reaction zone.
Given a reaction mechanism, equations for species mass
fractions, gas phase temperature and solid temperature are solved.
The reactor cascade consists of a variable number of cylindrical reactors.
The Rosseland model is used for radiative heat transfer by the solid.
A Nusselt number model is used to compute the heat transfer coefficient.
This example assumes finding steady-state solutions with constant pressure
so that mass controllers and pressure valves are not required. The code is written in
a general way to support an arbitrary number of reactors and an arbitrary number of
burner sections with different physical properties.

The implemented equations make use of Cantera's extensible reactor models.
Therefore, Cantera version 2.6.0 or higher is required.

The porous media burner considered in this example is a cylindrical tube filled
three different porous materials: a porous ceramic made from a Yttria-stabilized
Zirconia Alumina (YZA) section with length of 2 inches and pore density of 40 pores per
inches (PPI) which is supposed to act as the flame arrestor and therefore chemical
reactions in this section are disabled, even though flashback is observed for high
hydrogen dilution in the measurements. Next, a one inch section with a porous ceramic
made from silicon carbide (SiC) with 3 PPI is used and finally a 1 inch section of SiC
with 10 PPI. A flame stabilizes at the interface between the YZA and 3 PPI SiC.

                inert            flame location   heat recirculation

This example simplifies the complex interaction between heat transport in the gas-phase
and solid-phase by using a reactor cascade. While key trends from the measurements can
be recovered qualitatively, stability limits (blowoff and flashback) show large
discrepancies to the measurements, as the interface stabilization requires detailed
modeling of internal heat recirculation through heat transfer, conduction and
radiation. For more realistic and quantitative predictions, running 1D simulations with
full radiation transport is required.
