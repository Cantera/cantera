======================================================

The model shown in this example simulates heterogeneous catalytic processes inside
packed-bed, catalytic membrane reactors. The gas-phase and surface-phase species
conservation equations are derived and the system of differential-algebraic equations
(DAE) is solved using the ``scikits.odes.dae`` IDA solver.

# %%
# Methodology
# -----------
#
# A one-dimensional, steady-state catalytic-membrane reactor model with surface
# chemistry is developed to analyze species profiles along the length of a packed-bed,
# catalytic membrane reactor. The same model can further be simplified to simulate a
# simple packed-bed reactor by excluding the membrane. The example here demonstrates the
# one-dimensional reactor model explained by G. Kogekar [1]_.

# %%
# Governing equations
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Assuming steady-state, one-dimensional flow within the packed bed, total-mass, species
# mass and energy conservation may be stated as [2]_:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{d(\rho u)}{dz} &= \sum_{k=1}^{K_\t{g}} \dot {s}_k W_k A_\t{s}
#                          + \frac{P_\t{b}}{A_\t{b}} j_{k_\t{M}}, \\
#
#     \rho u \frac{dY_k}{dz} + A_\t{s} Y_k \sum_{k=1}^{K_\t{g}} \dot {s}_k W_k &=
#          A_\t{s} \dot {s}_k W_k + \delta_{k, k_\t{M}} \frac{P_\t{b}}{A_\t{b}} j_{k_\t{M}}, \\
#
#     \rho u c_\t{p} \frac{dT}{dz}
#         + \sum_{k=1}^{K_\t{g}} h_k (\phi_\t{g} \dot {\omega}_k + A_\t{s} \dot {s}_k) W_k
#         &= \hat h \frac{P_\t{b}}{A_\t{b}}(T_\t{w} - T)
#         + \delta_{k, k_\t{M}} \frac{P_\t{b}}{A_\t{b}} h_{k_\t{M}}  j_{k_\t{M}}.
#
# The fractional coverages of the :math:`K_\t{s}` surface adsorbates :math:`\theta_k`
# must satisfy
#
# .. math::
#     \dot {s}_k = 0, \qquad (k = 1,\ldots, K_\t{s}),
#
# which, at steady state, requires no net production/consumption of surface species by
# the heterogeneous reactions [3]_.
#
# The pressure within the bed is calculated as:
#
# .. math::
#     \frac{dp}{dz} = - \left( \frac{\phi_\t{g} \mu}{\beta_\t{g}} \right) u,
#
# where :math:`\mu` is the gas-phase mixture viscosity. The packed-bed permeability
# :math:\beta_\t{g}` is evaluated using the Kozeny-Carman relationship as
#
# .. math::
#     \beta_\t{g} = \frac{\phi_\t{g}^3 D_\t{p}^2}{72 \tau_\t{g}(1 - \phi_\t{g})^2},
#
# where :math:`\phi_\t{g}`, :math:`\tau_\t{g}`, and :math:`D_\t{p}` are the bed
# porosity, tortuosity, and particle diameter, respectively.
#
# The independent variable in these conservation equations is the position :math:`z`
# along the reactor length. The dependent variables include total mass flux :math:`\rho
# u`, pressure :math:`p`, temperature :math:`T`, gas-phase mass fractions :math:`Y_k`,
# and surfaces coverages :math:`\theta_k`. Gas-phase fluxes through the membrane are
# represented as :math:`j_{k, \t{M}}`. Geometric parameters :math:`A_\t{s}`,
# :math:`P_\t{b}`, and :math:`A_\t{b}` represent the catalyst specific surface area
# (dimensions of surface area per unit volume), reactor perimeter, and reactor
# cross-sectional flow area, respectively. Other parameters include bed porosity
# :math:`\phi_\t{g}` and gas-phase species molecular weights :math:`W_k`. The gas
# density :math:`\rho` is evaluated using the equation of state (such as ideal gas,
# Redlich-Kwong or Peng-Robinson).
#
# If a perm-selective membrane is present, then :math:`j_{k_\t{M}}` represents the
# gas-phase flux through the membrane and :math:`{k_\t{M}}` is the gas-phase species
# that permeates through the membrane. The Kronecker delta, :math:`\delta_{k, k_\t{M}} =
# 1` for the membrane-permeable species and :math:`\delta_{k, k_\t{M}} = 0` otherwise.
# The membrane flux is calculated using Sievert's law as
#
# .. math::
#     j_{k_\t{M}}^{\text{Mem}} =
#         \frac{B_{k_\t{M}}}{t} \left( p_{k_\t{M} {\text{, mem}}}^\alpha - p_{k_\t{M} \text{, sweep}}^\alpha \right) W_{k_\t{M}}
#
# where :math:`B_{k_\t{M}}` is the membrane permeability, :math:`t` is the membrane
# thickness. :math:`p_{k_\t{M} \text{, mem}}` and :math:`p_{k_\t{M} \text{, sweep}}`
# represent perm-selective species partial pressures within the packed-bed and the
# exterior sweep channel. The present model takes the pressure exponent :math:`\alpha`
# to be unity. The membrane flux for all other species (:math:`k \neq k_\t{M}`) is zero.
#
# Chemistry mechanism
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This example uses a detailed 12-step elementary micro-kinetic reaction mechanism that
# describes ammonia formation and decomposition kinetics over the Ru/Ba-YSZ catalyst.
# The reaction mechanism is developed and validated using measured performance in a
# laboratory-scale packed-bed reactor [4]_. This example also incorporates a Pd-based
# Hâ‚‚ perm-selective membrane.
#
# Solver
# ^^^^^^
#
# The above governing equations represent a complete solution for a steady-state
# packed-bed, catalytic membrane reactor model. The dependent variables are the
# mass-flux :math:`\rho u`, species mass-fractions :math:`Y_k`, pressure :math:`p`,
# temperature :math:`T`, and surface coverages :math:`\theta_k`. The equation of state
# is used to obtain the mass density, :math:`\rho`.
#
# The governing equations form an initial value problem (IVP) in a
# differential-algebraic (DAE) form as follows:
#
# .. math::
#    f(z,{\bf{y}}, {\bf y'}, {\bf c}) = {\bf 0},
#
# where :math:`\bf y` and :math:`\bf y'` represent the state vector and its derivative
# vector, respectively. All other constants such as reference temperature, chemical
# constants, etc. are incorporated in vector :math:`\bf c` (Refer to [1]_ for more
# details). This type of DAE system in this example is solved using the
# ``scikits.odes.dae`` IDA solver.
