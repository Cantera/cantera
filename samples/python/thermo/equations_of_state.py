Non-ideal equations of state
============================

This example demonstrates a comparison between ideal and non-ideal equations of
state (EoS) using Cantera and CoolProp.

The following equations of state are used to evaluate thermodynamic properties
in this example:

1. Ideal-gas EoS from Cantera
2. Non-ideal Redlich-Kwong EoS (R-K EoS) from Cantera
3. Helmholtz energy EoS (HEOS) from CoolProp

Requires: cantera >= 3.0.0, matplotlib >= 2.0, coolprop >= 6.0

# -----------------------------------------------
#
# `CoolProp <http://coolprop.org>`__ [1]_ is an open-source package that contains a
# highly-accurate database for thermophysical properties. The thermodynamic properties
# are obtained using pure and pseudo-pure fluid equations of state implemented for 122
# components.
#
# If you are using ``conda`` to manage your software environment, activate your cantera
# environment and install CoolProp by running ``conda install -c conda-forge coolprop``.

#%%
# Helper functions
# ----------------
#
# This example uses CO\ :math:`_2` as the only species. The function
# ``get_thermo_Cantera`` calculates thermodynamic properties based on the thermodynamic
# state (:math:`T`, :math:`p`) of the species using Cantera. Applicable phases are
# ``Ideal-gas`` and ``Redlich-Kwong``. The ideal-gas equation can be stated as
#
# .. math::
#     pv = RT,
#
# where :math:`p`, :math:`v` and :math:`T` represent thermodynamic pressure, molar
# volume, and the temperature of the gas-phase. :math:`R` is the universal gas constant.
# The Redlich-Kwong equation is a cubic, non-ideal equation of state, represented as
#
# .. math::
#     p=\frac{RT}{v-b^\ast}-\frac{a^\ast}{v\sqrt{T}(v+b^\ast)}.
#
# In this expression, :math:`R` is the universal gas constant and :math:`v` is the molar
# volume. The temperature-dependent van der Waals attraction parameter :math:`a^\ast`
# and volume correction parameter (repulsive parameter) :math:`b^\ast` represent
# molecular interactions.
#
# The function ``get_thermo_CoolProp`` utilizes the CoolProp package to evaluate
# thermodynamic properties based on the thermodynamic state (:math:`T`, :math:`p`) for a
# given fluid. The HEOS for CO\ :math:`_2` used in this example is obtained from
# http://www.coolprop.org/fluid_properties/fluids/CarbonDioxide.html.
#
# Since the standard-reference thermodynamic states are different for Cantera and
# CoolProp, it is necessary to convert these values to an appropriate scale before
# comparison. Therefore, both functions ``get_thermo_Cantera`` and
# ``get_thermo_CoolProp`` return the thermodynamic values relative to a reference state
# at 1 bar, 300 K.
#
# To plot the comparison of thermodynamic properties among the three EoS, the ``plot``
# function is used.

    ideal_gas_phase, T, p
)

# Read the Redlich-Kwong phase

h_RK, u_RK, s_RK, cp_RK, cv_RK = get_thermo_Cantera(redlich_kwong_phase, T, p)

# Read the thermo data using CoolProp
h_CoolProp, u_CoolProp, s_CoolProp, cp_CoolProp, cv_CoolProp = get_thermo_CoolProp(T, p)

# Plot the results
plot(p, u_ideal, u_RK, u_CoolProp, "Relative Internal Energy [kJ/kg]")
#%%
plot(p, h_ideal, h_RK, h_CoolProp, "Relative Enthalpy [kJ/kg]")
#%%
plot(p, s_ideal, s_RK, s_CoolProp, "Relative Entropy [kJ/kg-K]")

#%%
# The thermodynamic properties such as internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy are
# plotted against the operating pressure at a constant temperature :math:`T = 300` K.
# The three equations follow each other closely at low pressures (:math:`P < 10` bar).
# However, the ideal gas EoS departs significantly from the observed behavior of gases
# near the critical regime (:math:`P_{\rm {crit}} = 73.77` bar).
#
# The ideal gas EoS does not consider inter-molecular interactions and the volume
# occupied by individual gas particles. At low temperatures and high pressures,
# inter-molecular forces become particularly significant due to a reduction in
# inter-molecular distances. Additionally, at high density, the volume of individual
# molecules becomes significant. Both of these factors contribute to the deviation from
# ideal behavior at high pressures. The cubic Redlich-Kwong EoS, on the other hand,
# predicts thermodynamic properties accurately near the critical regime.

# Specific heat at constant pressure
plot(p, cp_ideal, cp_RK, cp_CoolProp, "$C_p$ [kJ/kg-K]")
#%%

# Specific heat at constant volume
plot(p, cv_ideal, cv_RK, cv_CoolProp, "$C_v$ [kJ/kg-K]")

#%%
# In the case of Ideal gas EoS, the specific heats at constant pressure (:math:`C_{\rm
# p}`) and constant volume (:math:`C_{\rm v}`) are independent of the pressure. Hence,
# :math:`C_{\rm p}` and :math:`C_{\rm v}` for ideal EoS do not change as the pressure is
# varied from :math:`1` bar to :math:`100` bar in this study.
#
# :math:`C_{\rm p}` for the R-K EoS follows the trend closely with the Helmholtz EoS
# from CoolProp up to the critical regime. Although :math:`C_{\rm p}` shows reasonable
# agreement with the Helmholtz EoS in sub-critical and supercritical regimes, it
# inaccurately predicts a very high value near the critical point. However,
# :math:`C_{\rm p}` at the critical point is finite for the real fluid. The sudden rise
# in :math:`C_{\rm p}` in the case of the R-K EoS is just a numerical artifact, due to
# the EoS yielding infinite values in the limiting case, and not a real singularity.
#
# :math:`C_{\rm v}`, on the other hand, predicts smaller values in the subcritical and
# critical regime. However, it shows completely incorrect values in the super-critical
# region, making it invalid at very high pressures. It is well known that the cubic
# equations typically fail to predict accurate constant-volume heat capacity in the
# transcritical region [2]_. Certain cubic EoS models have been extended to resolve this
# discrepancy using crossover models. For further information, see the work of Span [2]_
# and Saeed et al.Â [3]_.

# The figure compares :math:`T-\rho` plots for ideal, R-K, and Helmholtz EoS at
# different operating pressures. All three EoS yield the same plots at low pressures (0
# bar and 10 bar). However, the Ideal gas EoS departs significantly at high pressures
# (:math:`P > 10` bar), where non-ideal effects are prominent. The R-K EoS closely
# matches the Helmholtz EoS at supercritical pressures (:math:`P \ge 70` bar). However,
# it does depart in the liquid-vapor region that exists at :math:`P < P_{\rm {crit}}`
# and low temperatures (:math:`~T_{\rm {crit}}`).
