C (legacy) Examples
========================

These examples demonstrate the usage of Cantera's legacy C interface library,
``clib``, which can also be used to call Cantera from other languages that are able to
call C functions.

.. caution::
    The CLib interface is an experimental part of the Cantera API and may be changed
    or removed without notice.
