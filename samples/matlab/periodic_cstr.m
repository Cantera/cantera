%  Periodic CSTR
%
%  This example illustrates a CSTR with steady inputs but periodic
%  interior state.  A stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen mixture is
%  introduced and reacts to produce water.  But since water has a
%  large efficiency as a third body in the chain termination reaction
%
%         H + O2 + M = HO2 + M
%
%  as soon as a significant amount of water is produced the reaction
%  stops. After enough time has passed that the water is exhausted from
%  the reactor, the mixture explodes again and the process
%  repeats. This explanation can be verified by decreasing the rate for
%  reaction 7 in file 'h2o2.cti' and re-running the example.
%
%  Acknowledgments: The idea for this example and an estimate of the
%  conditions needed to see the oscillations came from Bob Kee,
%  Colorado School of Mines

% Create a heat-conducting wall between the reactor and the
