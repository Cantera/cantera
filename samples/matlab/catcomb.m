% Catalytic combustion of a stagnation flow on a platinum surface
%
% This script solves a catalytic combustion problem. A stagnation flow
% is set up, with a gas inlet 10 cm from a platinum surface at 900
% K. The lean, premixed methane/air mixture enters at ~ 6 cm/s (0.06
% kg/m2/s), and burns catalytically on the platinum surface. Gas-phase
% chemistry is included too, and has some effect very near the
% surface.
%
% The catalytic combustion mechanism is from Deutschman et al., 26th
% Symp. (Intl.) on Combustion,1996 pp. 1747-1754

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% create the gas object %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This object will be used to evaluate all thermodynamic, kinetic,
% and transport properties
%
% The gas phase will be taken from the definition of phase 'gas' in
% input file 'ptcombust.cti,' which is a stripped-down version of
% GRI-Mech 3.0.
gas = importPhase('ptcombust.cti','gas');
set(gas,'T',tinlet,'P',p,'X',comp1);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% create the interface object %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This object will be used to evaluate all surface chemical production
% rates. It will be created from the interface definition 'Pt_surf'
% in input file 'ptcombust.cti,' which implements the reaction
% mechanism of Deutschmann et al., 1995 for catalytic combustion on
% platinum.
%
surf_phase = importInterface('ptcombust.cti','Pt_surf',gas);
setTemperature(surf_phase, tsurf);

% integrate the coverage equations in time for 1 s, holding the gas
% composition fixed to generate a good starting estimate for the
% coverages.
advanceCoverages(surf_phase, 1.0);

% The two objects we just created are independent of the problem
% type -- they are useful in zero-D simulations, 1-D simulations,
% etc. Now we turn to creating the objects that are specifically
% for 1-D simulations. These will be 'stacked' together to create
% the complete simulation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% create the flow object %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The flow object is responsible for evaluating the 1D governing
% equations for the flow. We will initialize it with the gas
% object, and assign it the name 'flow'.

%  specified. This object provides the inlet boundary conditions for
%  the flow equations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% create the surface %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This object provides the surface boundary conditions for the flow
% equations. By supplying object surface_phase as an argument, the
% coverage equations for its surface species will be added to the
% equation set, and used to compute the surface production rates of
% the gas-phase species.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%% create the stack  %%%%%%%%%%%%

% Once the component parts have been created, they can be assembled
% to create the 1D simulation.
