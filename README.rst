What is Cantera?
================

Cantera is an open-source collection of object-oriented software tools for
problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C++
and Fortran 90. A number of `examples of Cantera's capabilities
<https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter>`_ are available in the form of
Jupyter notebooks. These examples can be tried interactively, in the cloud by
using the following MyBinder link:

   :target: https://gitter.im/Cantera/Lobby


The `Cantera Gitter Chat <https://gitter.im/Cantera/Lobby>`_ is a public chat
client that is linked to users' Github account. The developers do not closely
monitor the discussion, so *any* discussion at all of Cantera functionality
such as how to use certain function calls, syntax problems, input files, etc.
should be directed the User's Group. All conversations in the Gitter room will
be covered under the Cantera Code of Conduct, so please be nice.

The chat room is a place to strengthen and develop the Cantera community,
discuss tangentially-related topics such as how to model the underlying physics
of a problem , share cool applications you’ve developed, etc.

Summary:

“How do I perform this Cantera function call?” --> User's Group

"What do I do with the variables that a Cantera function call returns?” -->
