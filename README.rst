Version 2.3.0a3 (development)

What is Cantera?
================

Cantera is an open-source collection of object-oriented software tools for
problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport
processes. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C++
and Fortran 90. A number of `examples of Cantera's capabilities
<https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter>`_ are available in the form of
Jupyter notebooks. These examples can be tried interactively, in the cloud by
using the following Binder link:
