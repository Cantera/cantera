For **help**, **support** and **questions** please create a post on the
**[Cantera Users' Group](https://groups.google.com/group/cantera-users)**.
Any discussion of Cantera functionality such as how to use certain function
calls, syntax problems, input files, etc. should be directed to the Users' Group.

Further, the **[Cantera Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/Cantera/Lobby)** is an
infrequently monitored chat room that can be used to discuss tangentially-related
topics such as how to model the underlying physics of a problem, share cool
applications that you have developed, etc.

Please **_do not_** raise an issue on GitHub unless it is a bug report or a
feature request. Issues that do not fall into these categories will be closed.
If you're not sure, please make a post on the
[Users' Group](https://groups.google.com/group/cantera-users) and someone will
be able to help you out.
