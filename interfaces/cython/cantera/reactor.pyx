    r"""
    A Wall separates two reactors, or a reactor and a reservoir. A wall has a
    finite area, may conduct or radiate heat between the two reactors on either
    side, and may move like a piston.

    Walls are stateless objects in Cantera, meaning that no differential
    equation is integrated to determine any wall property. Since it is the wall
    (piston) velocity that enters the energy equation, this means that it is
    the velocity, not the acceleration or displacement, that is specified.
    The wall velocity is computed from

    .. math:: v = K(P_{\rm left} - P_{\rm right}) + v_0(t),

    where :math:`K` is a non-negative constant, and :math:`v_0(t)` is a
    specified function of time. The velocity is positive if the wall is
    moving to the right.

    The heat flux through the wall is computed from

    .. math::  q = U(T_{\rm left} - T_{\rm right}) + \epsilon\sigma (T_{\rm left}^4 - T_{\rm right}^4) + q_0(t),

    where :math:`U` is the overall heat transfer coefficient for
    conduction/convection, and :math:`\epsilon` is the emissivity. The function
    :math:`q_0(t)` is a specified function of time. The heat flux is positive
    when heat flows from the reactor on the left to the reactor on the right.

    A heterogeneous reaction mechanism may be specified for one or both of the
    wall surfaces. The mechanism object (typically an instance of class
    `Interface`) must be constructed so that it is properly linked to
    the object representing the fluid in the reactor the surface in question
    faces. The surface temperature on each side is taken to be equal to the
    temperature of the reactor it faces.
