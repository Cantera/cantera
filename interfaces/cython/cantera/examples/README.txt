Starting with Cantera 3.0, Python examples are no longer packaged with the Python
module. Examples illustrating the usage of the Python module can be found on Cantera's
website (https://cantera.org). Alternatively, examples can be accessed in the directory
"samples/python" of the source code, which can be retrieved from the project's GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Cantera/cantera).
