"""
A simplistic approach to mechanism reduction which demonstrates Cantera's
features for dynamically manipulating chemical mechanisms.

Here, we use the full GRI 3.0 mechanism to simulate adiabatic, constant pressure
ignition of a lean methane/air mixture. We track the maximum reaction rates for
each reaction to determine which reactions are the most important, according to
a simple metric based on the relative net reaction rate.

We then create a sequence of reduced mechanisms including only the top reactions
and the associated species, and run the simulations again with these mechanisms
to see whether the reduced mechanisms with a certain number of species are able
to adequately simulate the ignition delay problem.
