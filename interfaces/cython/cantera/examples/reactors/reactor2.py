"""
Two reactors connected with a piston, with heat loss to the environment

This script simulates the following situation. A closed cylinder with volume 2
m^3 is divided into two equal parts by a massless piston that moves with speed
proportional to the pressure difference between the two sides.  It is
initially held in place in the middle. One side is filled with 1000 K argon at
20 atm, and the other with a combustible 500 K methane/air mixture at 0.1 atm
(phi = 1.1). At t = 0 the piston is released and begins to move due to the
large pressure difference, compressing and heating the methane/air mixture,
which eventually explodes. At the same time, the argon cools as it expands.
The piston is adiabatic, but some heat is lost through the outer cylinder
walls to the environment.

Note that this simulation, being zero-dimensional, takes no account of shock
wave propagation. It is somewhat artifical, but nevertheless instructive.
