"""
Calculate steady-state solutions for a combustor, modeled as a single well-stirred
reactor, for different residence times.

We are interested in the steady-state burning solution. This example explores
the effect of changing the residence time on completeness of reaction (through
the burned gas temperature) and on the total heat release rate.

Demonstrates the use of a MassFlowController where the mass flow rate function
depends on variables other than time by capturing these variables from the
enclosing scope. Also shows the use of a PressureController to create a constant
pressure reactor with a fixed volume.
