  brief: Print a summary of the state of the phase to the logger.
  what: method
  declaration: int32_t thermo_print(int32_t handle, int32_t showThermo, double threshold)
  parameters:
    handle: Handle to queried ThermoPhase object.
    showThermo: If true, extra information is printed out about the thermodynamic state of the system.
    threshold: Show information about species with mole fractions greater than
  returns: Zero for success or -1 for exception handling.
  uses:
  - virtual string ThermoPhase::report(bool, double)
