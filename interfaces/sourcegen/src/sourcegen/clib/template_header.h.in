 *  This library of functions is designed to encapsulate %Cantera functionality
 *  and make it available for use in languages and applications other than C++.
 *  A set of library functions is provided that are declared "extern C". All
 *  %Cantera objects are stored and referenced by integers - no pointers are
 *  passed to or from the calling application.
 *
 *  This file was generated by sourcegen. It will be re-generated by the
 *  %Cantera build process. Do not manually edit.
 *
 *  @warning  This library is an experimental part of the %Cantera API and
 *      may be changed without notice.
