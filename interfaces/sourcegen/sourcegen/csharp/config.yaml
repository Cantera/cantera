# Provides info for scaffolding higher-level idiomatic C# classes
# At this stage, we can scaffold simple properties that follow the
# naming conventions _prop, _setProp for scalars and
# _getProp, _setProp for array-likes (string, double[]).
# The C# class name will be determine by the class crosswalk above.
# The C# property names are the values for the CLib "property" keys.
