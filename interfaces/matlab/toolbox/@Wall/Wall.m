function x = Wall(left, right, area, k, u, q, v)
% WALL  Wall class constructor.
% x = Wall(left, right, area, k, u, q, v)
% A Wall separates two reactors, or a reactor and a reservoir. A wall has a
% finite area, may conduct heat between the two reactors on either
% side, and may move like a piston.
%
% Walls are stateless objects in Cantera, meaning that no differential
% equation is integrated to determine any wall property. Since it is the wall
% (piston) velocity that enters the energy equation, this means that it is
% the velocity, not the acceleration or displacement, that is specified.
% The wall velocity is computed from
%
% .. math:: v = K(P_{\rm left} - P_{\rm right}) + v_0(t),
%
% where :math:`K` is a non-negative constant, and :math:`v_0(t)` is a
% specified function of time. The velocity is positive if the wall is
% moving to the right.
%
% The heat flux through the wall is computed from
%
% .. math::  q = U(T_{\rm left} - T_{\rm right}) + q_0(t),
%
% where :math:`U` is the overall heat transfer coefficient for
% conduction/convection. The function
% :math:`q_0(t)` is a specified function of time. The heat flux is positive
% when heat flows from the reactor on the left to the reactor on the right.
%
% Note: all of the arguments are optional and can be activated after initial
% construction by using the various methods of the :mat:func:`Wall` class.
% Any improperly specified arguments will generate warnings; these can be ignored
% if the intention was to not use a particular argument. Thus, the velocity of
% the wall can be set by using empty strings or 0.0 for each of the arguments before
% the velocity with no harm.
%
% :param left:
%     Instance of class :mat:func:`Reactor` to be used as the bulk phase on
%     the left side of the wall. See :mat:func:`install`
% :param right:
%     Instance of class :mat:func:`Reactor` to be used as the bulk phase on
%     the right side of the wall. See :mat:func:`install`
% :param area:
%     The area of the wall in m**2. See :mat:func:`area` and :mat:func:`setArea`.
%     Defaults to 1.0 m**2 if not specified.
% :param k:
%     Expansion rate coefficient in m/(s-Pa). See :mat:func:`setExpansionRateCoeff`
%     and :mat:func:`vdot`. Defaults to 0.0 if not specified.
% :param u:
%     Heat transfer coefficient in W/(m**2-K). See :mat:func:`setHeatTransferCoeff`
%     and :mat:func:`qdot`. Defaults to 0.0 if not specified.
% :param q:
%     Heat flux in W/m**2. Must be an instance of :mat:func:`Func`. See
%     :mat:func:`setHeatFlux` and :mat:func:`qdot`. Defaults to 0.0 if not specified.
% :param v:
%     Velocity of the wall in m/s. Must be an instance of :mat:func:`Func`. See
%     :mat:func:`setVelocity` and :mat:func:`vdot`. Defaults to 0.0 if not specified.
% :return:
%     Instance of class :mat:func:`Wall`
