function m = Methane()
% METHANE  Return an object representing methane.
% m = Methane()
% The object returned by this method implements an accurate equation of
% state for methane that can be used in the liquid, vapor, saturated
% liquid/vapor, and supercritical regions of the phase diagram.  The
% equation of state is taken from
