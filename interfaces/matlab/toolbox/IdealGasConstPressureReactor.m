function r = IdealGasConstPressureReactor(contents)
% IDEALGASCONSTPRESSUREREACTOR  Create a constant pressure reactor with an ideal gas.
% r = IdealGasConstPressureReactor(contents)
% An IdealGasConstPressureReactor is an instance of class Reactor where the
% pressure is held constant. The volume is not a state variable, but
% instead takes on whatever value is consistent with holding the pressure
% constant. Additionally, its governing equations are specialized for the
% ideal gas equation of state (and do not work correctly with other
% thermodynamic models). Examples:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%     r1 = IdealGasConstPressureReactor      % an empty reactor
%     r2 = IdealGasConstPressureReactor(gas) % a reactor containing a gas
%

% :param contents:
%     Cantera :mat:func:`Solution` to be set as the contents of the
%     reactor
% :return:
%     Instance of class :mat:func:`Reactor`
