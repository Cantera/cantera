function w = Water()
% WATER  Return an object representing water.
% w = Water()
% The object returned by this method implements an accurate equation of
% state for water that can be used in the liquid, vapor, saturated
% liquid/vapor, and supercritical regions of the phase diagram. The
% equation of state is taken from
