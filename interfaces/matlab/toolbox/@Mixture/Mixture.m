function m = Mixture(phases)
% MIXTURE  Multiphase mixture class constructor.
% m = Mixture(phases)
% Class :mat:func:`Mixture` represents mixtures of one or more phases of matter.
% To construct a mixture, supply a cell array of phases and
% mole numbers::
%
%     >> gas = importPhase('gas.cti');
%     >> graphite = importPhase('graphite.cti');
%     >> mix = Mixture({gas, 1.0; graphite, 0.1});
%
% Phases may also be added later using the addPhase method::
%
%     >> water = importPhase('water.cti');
%     >> addPhase(mix, water, 3.0);
%
% Note that the objects representing each phase compute only the
% intensive state of the phase - they do not store any information
% on the amount of this phase. Mixture objects, on the other hand,
% represent the full extensive state.
%
% Mixture objects are 'lightweight' in the sense that they do not
% store parameters needed to compute thermodynamic or kinetic
% properties of the phases. These are contained in the
% ('heavyweight') phase objects. Multiple mixture objects may be
% constructed using the same set of phase objects. Each one stores
% its own state information locally, and synchronizes the phase
% objects whenever it requires phase properties.
%
% :param phases:
%     Cell array of phases and mole numbers
% :return:
%     Instance of class :mat:func:`Mixture`
