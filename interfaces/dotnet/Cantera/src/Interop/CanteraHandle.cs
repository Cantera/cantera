/// The base class for a handle to a Cantera object.
/// </summary>
/// </remarks>
/// We use the SafeHandle class, which has low-level support in the runtime to ensure
/// proper reference counting and cleanup and is thread-safe. This allows us to use
/// the dispose pattern easily and safely and without having to write our own finalizer.
/// Cantera uses signed 32-bit ints for handles, yet SafeHandle uses
/// "native int" IntPtr. The Value and IsValid properties are designed to account for
/// this and only consider the lower 32-bit of the IntPtr on 64-bit systems.
/// <remarks>
