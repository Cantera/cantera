    % Wall Class ::
    %
    %     >> x = Wall(l, r, name)
    %
    % A Wall separates two reactors, or a reactor and a reservoir.
    % A Wall has a finite area, may conduct heat between the two
    % reactors on either side, and may move like a piston.
    %
    % Walls are stateless objects in Cantera, meaning that no
    % differential equation is integrated to determine any wall
    % property. Since it is the wall (piston) velocity that enters
    % the energy equation, this means that it is the velocity, not
    % the acceleration or displacement, that is specified. The wall
    % velocity is computed from:
    %
    % .. math:: v = K(P_{left} - P_{right}) + v_0(t),
    %
    % where K is a non-negative constant, and v_0 is a specified
    % function of time. The velocity is positive if the wall is
    % moving to the right.
    %
    % The heat flux through the wall is computed from:
    %
    %  .. math:: q = U(T_{left} - T_{right}) + q_0(t),
    %
    % where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient for
    % conduction/convection, and q_0 is a specified function of
    % time. The heat flux is positive when heat flows from the
    % reactor on the left to the reactor on the right.
    %
    % Note: the Wall class constructor only assign default values
    % to various properties. The user could specify those properties
    % after initial construction by using the various methods of
    % the Wall class.
