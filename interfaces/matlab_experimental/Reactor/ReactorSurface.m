    %     >> s = ReactorSurface(surf, reactor, name)
    %
    % A surface on which heterogeneous reactions take place. The
    % mechanism object (typically an instance of :mat:class:`Interface`)
    % must be constructed so that it is properly linked to the
    % object representing the fluid in the reactor. The surface
    % temperature on each side is taken to be equal to the
    % temperature of the reactor.
    %
    % :param surf:
    %    Surface reaction mechanisms for the left-facing surface.
    %    This must bean instance of class :mat:class:`Kinetics`, or of a class
    %    derived from Kinetics, such as :mat:class:`Interface`.
    % :param reactor:
    %    Instance of class 'Reactor' to be used as the adjacent bulk phase.
    % :param name:
    %    Reactor surface name (optional; default is ``(none)``).
    % :return:
    %    Instance of class :mat:class:`ReactorSurface`.
