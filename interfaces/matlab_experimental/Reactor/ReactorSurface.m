    % A surface on which heterogeneous reactions take place. The
    % mechanism object (typically an instance of class 'Interface')
    % mustb be constructed so that it is properly linked to the
    % object representing the fluid in the reactor. The surface
    % temperature on each side is taken to be equal to the
    % temprature of the reactor.
    %
    % Note: all of the arguments are optional and can be activated
    % after initial construction by using the various methods of
    % the 'ReactorSurface' class.
    %
    % :param kleft:
    %    Surface reaction mechanisms for the left-facing surface.
    %    This must bean instance of class 'Kinetics', or of a class
    %    derived from 'Kinetics', such as 'Interface'.
    % :param reactor:
    %    Instance of class 'Reactor' to be used as the adjacent
    %    bulk phase.
    % :param area:
    %    The area of the surface in m^2. Defaults to 1.0 m^2 if not
    %    specified.
    % :return:
    %    Instance of class 'ReactorSurface'.
