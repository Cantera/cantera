This is a chemical kinetics library. 

<h2>Chemical Kinetics Overview</h2>

This library is designed to simplify the process of accessing chemical kinetics.

<h2>PECOS Center Background</h2>

The Center for Predictive Engineering and COmputational Sciences (PECOS) is a DOE-funded Center 
of Excellence within the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) 
at The University of Texas at Austin. PECOS is one of five such centers sponsored under 
the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) of the National Nuclear Security 
Administrationâ€™s Advanced Simulation and Computing Program.

PECOS brings together an interdisciplinary, multi-university team with partners at the 
DOE National Labs and NASA. The goal of the PECOS Center is to develop the next generation 
of advanced computational methods for predictive simulation of multiscale, multiphysics phenomena, 
and to apply these methods to the analysis of vehicles reentering the atmosphere. In pursuing 
this research, PECOS is advancing the science and modeling of atmospheric reentry, and 
the science of predictive simulation.
