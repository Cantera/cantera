# %Cantera C++ Reference

Use the menu at the top to view detailed documentation of the code, or use the
following shortcuts:

* Overview of [**Cantera Modules**](modules.html)
* Index of [**Cantera Classes**](classes.html)

A topical overview is provided as follows:

* @ref solnGroup (interface to %Cantera core objects)
* @ref thermoprops (temperature, pressure, energy, ...)
* @ref chemkinetics (reactions, rates of progress, reaction path analysis, ...)
* @ref tranprops (diffusion, viscosity, thermal conductivity, ...)
* @ref ZeroD (reactors, walls, flow devices, ...)
* @ref onedim (flames, flow domains, boundaries, ...)
* @ref physConstants (universal constants, built into %Cantera for convenience)

For fundamental scientific theory used for the implementation of %Cantera, refer to the
[Cantera Science Section](https://cantera.org/science/index.html) of the
[Cantera Website](https://cantera.org).

The %Cantera source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera).
