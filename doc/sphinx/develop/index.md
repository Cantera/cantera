## Compiling Cantera from Source

If you're interested in contributing new features to Cantera, or you want to try the
latest and development version, you will need to compile Cantera from source. The first
step is to make sure you have all the [](compiling/compilation-reqs) installed. Then,
you can [download the Cantera source code](compiling/source-code). Finally, you can
determine the appropriate configuration options and [compile
Cantera](compiling/configure-build) on your computer.

The following additional references may also be useful:
