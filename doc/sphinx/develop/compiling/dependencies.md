# Software used by Cantera

This section lists the versions of third-party software that are required to build and
use Cantera.

## Compilers

You must have one of the following C++ compilers installed on your system. A Fortran
compiler is required only if you plan to build the Fortran module.

- GNU compilers (C/C++/Fortran)

  - Known to work with versions 9.4 and 11.4. Expected to work with version >= 9.0.

- Clang/LLVM (C/C++)

  - Known to work with versions 10 and 12. Expected to work with version >= 5.0
  - Works with the versions included in Xcode 13.0 and 14.3.1.

- Intel compilers (C/C++/Fortran)

  - Known to work with the Intel OneAPI Compilers (version 2022.0.2).
  - Some earlier versions of the Intel compiler (including the 2017 version) are
    **NOT RECOMMENDED** because of a bug in the C compiler.

- Microsoft compilers (C/C++)

  - Known to work with Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 14.1), Visual Studio 2019 (MSVC 14.2)
    and Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC 14.3).

  - Known to work with versions >= 3.0. Expected to work with versions \<= 7.0.
  - To use SUNDIALS with Cantera on a Linux/Unix system, it must be compiled
    with the `-fPIC` flag. You can specify this flag when configuring SUNDIALS as
    `cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC <other command-line options>`
