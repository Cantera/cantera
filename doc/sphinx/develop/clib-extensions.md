# Auto-Generated CLib API

```{warning}
The CLib API is an experimental part of Cantera and
may be changed or removed without notice.
```

In CLib, Cantera objects are stored and referenced by integers - no pointers are passed
to or from the calling application. Further, the contents of arrays and variables are
copied, which separates internal C++ memory management from the application using CLib.

## Code Generation

Before generating the CLib interface, ensure that an up-to-date Doxygen XML tree is
available. You can generate it by running:

```raw
$ scons doxygen
```

The CLib interface is then generated by running the following command from the root
folder of the Cantera source code:

```raw
$ python interfaces/sourcegen/run.py --api=clib --output=.
```

**sourcegen** injects the generated code directly into the Cantera source folder by
adding header files to `include/cantera/clib_experimental` and implementation files to
`src/clib_experimental`. The CLib interface becomes an integral part of Cantera's shared
libraries after compiling Cantera with the option:

```raw
$ scons build clib_experimental=y
```

## Layout of the CLib Source Generator

The CLib source generator is located in the `interfaces/sourcegen/sourcegen/clib`
folder. While the overall configuration follows available [](sourcegen-config), the
CLib source generator introduces additional configuration options, as detailed below.

### Configuration

The YAML file `config.yaml` contains configuration options specific to the CLib
interface.

- **Generic Options:** These options are common across all sourcegen variants and are
  based on the names of YAML configuration files. In the context of CLib, they are
  primarily useful for code maintenance:

    - `ignore_files`: A list of configuration files.
        Files listed here will be completely ignored during source generation.
    - `ignore_funcs`: A mapping of configuration file names to lists of recipe names.
        Functions listed in those files will not be scaffolded.

- **CLib-Specific Options:** These fields define options specific to the CLib interface
  and use base class names defined within the C++ Cantera namespace. Functions defined
  within Cantera's root namespace use `""` as the class name:

    - `preambles`: A mapping of class names to associated text blocks for preambles
      (headers).
    - `includes`: A mapping of class names to lists of C++ includes defining base
      classes and associated specializations.

### Implementation Details

- **Type Cross-Walks:** This section maps C++ types to their CLib equivalents.
  Implementation details for type cross-walks are defined in `_Config.py`:

    - `ret_type_crosswalk`: Specifies the types returned by C++ functions and methods.
    - `prop_type_crosswalk`: Specifies the types passed as parameters in C++ functions
      and methods.

- **Templates for Scaffolding:** Templates, powered by
  [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com), are used to scaffold elements of the CLib
  API. The following files define these templates:

    - `templates.yaml`: Defines code blocks within the header and implementation files.
    - `header_template.h.in`: Defines the template for header files.
    - `source_template.cpp.in`: Defines the template for implementation files.

- **Source Code:** The implementation of the CLib source generator is contained in
  `_CLibSourceGenerator.py`.

## Extending the CLib API

Sourcegen uses a one-to-one correspondence of YAML configuration files to C++ base
classes; derived classes are handled by the same configuration as the base class.

- **New Methods for Existing Configurations:** Add the name of the method as a new
  recipe; the new CLib function will become available once CLib is regenerated and
  Cantera is recompiled/reinstalled.

- **YAML Configuration for a C++ Base Class:** The CLib source generator implements
  templates for C++ interface patterns commonly used by Cantera.

  Follow the following steps for new classes and associated methods:

  1. Add a new YAML configuration file as described in [](sourcegen-config).
  1. Add include files specifying base class and specializations to the `includes`
     mapping in `config.yaml`.
  1. Regenerate the CLib interface and recompile/reinstall Cantera.
  1. Add new unit tests in `test/clib_experimental` to ensure that the new feature is
     working properly.

## Troubleshooting

The **sourcegen** utility uses a logging module to provide feedback. Add the verbose
`-v` option to generate additional feedback.

The CLib code generator is limited to type cross-walks defined in `_Config.py`. Beyond,
