# Automatic Code Generation Utility

```{warning}
The **sourcegen** utility is an experimental part of Cantera and may be changed or
removed without notice.
```

Cantera's **sourcegen** utility is a Python based source generator for creating Cantera
interfaces for other languages. The following output options are supported:

- `clib`: C interface; used to generate the [CLib API](../clib/index).
- `csharp`: C# interface; used to generate the [.NET API](../dotnet/index).
- `yaml`: YAML interface; simple illustration that summarizes the CLib interface in YAML
    format.

## Usage

The **sourcegen** utility is a command-line tool that is not separately installed.
Instead, it is run directly from the Cantera source code subfolder at
`interfaces/sourcegen/`. Running `python run.py --help` displays the following help
text:

```raw
usage: run.py [-h] [-v] [--api API] [--output OUTPUT]

Experimental source generator for creating Cantera interface code.

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose    show additional logging output
  --api API        language of generated Cantera API code
  --output OUTPUT  specifies the OUTPUT folder name

The **sourcegen** utility is invoked as follows::

    python path/to/sourcegen/run.py --api=csharp --output=.

where the relative path has to be provided as the utility is not installed.
Currently supported API options are: 'csharp', 'clib' and 'yaml'.
```

## Background

The **sourcegen** utility parses the XML tree generated by
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.org), using YAML configuration files that provide
instructions for constructing CLib interface functions from underlying C++ functions
and methods. For more information, see [](sourcegen-config).

The utility is used to generate the [CLib API](clib-extensions) itself, as well as
auto-generated language interfaces built on top of it, such as the .NET interface and
others.
