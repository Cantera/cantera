# Auto-Generated .NET API

```{warning}
The auto-generated .NET API is an experimental part of Cantera and
may be changed or removed without notice.
```

The (original) version of the .NET API builds on the traditional CLib API.

## C# Code Generation

Source generation for the .NET interface is fully integrated into the installation
routine of the [](../dotnet/index).

C# files used by the .NET API can be generated by running the following command from the
root folder of the Cantera source code:

```shell
% python interfaces/sourcegen/run.py --api=csharp --output=build/csharp
```

Auto-generated C# files are placed in the output folder `build/csharp`.

## .NET Source Generator Overview

```{note}
For current information on the .NET interface, refer to `interfaces/dotnet/README.md`.
