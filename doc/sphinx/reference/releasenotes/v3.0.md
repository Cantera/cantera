Instructions for installing Cantera 3.0 are available on the [Cantera website](/install/index).

## Highlights

- Major performance enhancements for reactor network calculations with large kinetic mechanisms. This comes from a new formulation for the reactor governing equations using species moles (rather than mass fractions) used together with a sparse, iterative solver in the ODE integrator that makes use of a semi-analytical Jacobian. ([`preconditioned_integration.py`](/examples/python/reactors/preconditioned_integration), [#1010](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1010), [#1344](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1344), [#1363](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1363), [#1377](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1377), [#1411](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1411))
- Introduce `ExtensibleRate` Python class that can be used to implement new reaction rate parameterizations in Python, with parameters defined in YAML input files. These rate types can be used even when the main user application is not written in Python. (class {py:class}`~cantera.ExtensibleRate`), [`custom_reactions.py`](/examples/python/kinetics/custom_reactions), [#1382](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1382), [#1417](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1417), [#1456](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1456), [#1478](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1478), [#1494](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1494), [#1499](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1499))
- Introduce a C++ `SolutionArray` class, which is now used as the backend for the Python `SolutionArray` class ([E#137](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/137), [#1385](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1385), [#1426](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1426), [#1458](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1458), [#1462](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1462), [#1464](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1464), [#1508](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1508), [#1520](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1520), [#1547](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1547), [#1585](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1585))
- Add "native" support for HDF5 as an input/output format for `SolutionArray` and 1D flames ([E#166](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/166), [`flame_initial_guess.py`](/examples/python/onedim/flame_initial_guess))
- Add a new thermo model, `coverage-dependent-surface` for representing surfaces where the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity of each species may depend on its coverage and the coverage of other species in the phase. (class {ct}`CoverageDependentSurfPhase`, [E#59](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/59), [#1135](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1135), [#1471](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1471), [#1529](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1529), [#1583](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1583))
- Add support for surface chemistry to the plug flow reactor model (class {py:class}`~cantera.FlowReactor`, [`1D_pfr_surfchem.py`](/examples/python/surface_chemistry/1D_pfr_surfchem), [`surf_pfr.py`](/examples/python/reactors/surf_pfr), [#1490](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1490))
- Add support for using real gas models (Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson) with the 1D flame solver ([E#109](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/109), [#1079](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1079))
- Introduction of the `yaml2ck` script, which converts Cantera's YAML mechanism format into the legacy Chemkin format. ([`yaml2ck.py`](/yaml/yaml2ck), [E#52](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/52), [#1286](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1286), [#1365](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1365), [#1420](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1420))
- Add an experimental Python module where Cantera returns dimensional values as quantities using the `pint` package. This is currently available only for thermo methods ([module `cantera.with_units`](/python/units), [`isentropic_units.py`](/examples/python/thermo/isentropic_units), [`rankine_units.py`](/examples/python/thermo/rankine_units), [`sound_speed_units.py`](/examples/python/thermo/sound_speed_units), [E#3](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/3), [#991](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/991), [#1569](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1569))
- Preview release of a new Matlab toolbox, with a rewritten API that makes use of modern Matlab features and replaces the difficult-to-maintain MEX-file based backend with one based on using `calllib` to interact directly with the Cantera C interface. (For the adventurous, see [`README.md`](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/main/interfaces/matlab_experimental/readme.md), [E#32](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/32), [#1182](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1182), [#1496](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1496), [#1498](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1498))

## Changes to existing capabilities

- `BulkKinetics` now handles kinetics for any bulk phase, given the appropriate reaction rate parameterizations. As a result, `GasKinetics` is deprecated in favor of `BulkKinetics` ([#1483](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1483))
- Rename C++ phase setter mnemonics to use `D` for density instead of `R` for rho, for example `setState_TR` is deprecated in favor of `setState_TD` ([#1433](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1433))
- Introduce properties for certain reactor features in Python and deprecate the old getter/setter methods. `ReactorNet.initial_time` replaces `ReactorNet.set_initial_time()`, `Wall.velocity` replaces `Wall.set_velocity()`, `Wall.heat_flux` replaces `Wall.set_heat_flux()`, `Wall.expansion_rate` replaces `wall.vdot`, `Wall.heat_rate` replaces `wall.qdot()`, `Valve.time_function` replaces `Valve.set_time_function()`, `MassFlowController.pressure_function` replaces `MassFlowController.set_pressure_function()` and `PressureController.primary` replaces `PressureController.set_master()` ([E#160](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/160), [#1515](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1515))

- Disable irrelevant warnings for extinct diffusion flames ([#1336](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1336))
- Moved Python test suite and examples out of the Python module; they are no longer installed as part of the Cantera Python package.
