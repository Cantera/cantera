# Reference

This pages provide detailed reference documentation for Cantera.

## Programming Reference

These sections document the classes and functions that define the Cantera interface for
each available programming language, as well as the structure of Cantera's YAML
mechanism files.

## Science Reference

These sections document the scientific theories, mathematical models, and numerical
methods implemented by Cantera. This starts with some of the fundamental scientific
theory underpinning the ways that Cantera models phases of matter, which involves
calculations for thermodynamic and transport properties and chemical reaction rates.
Cantera then builds on top of these models to provide means of representing and solving
a number of zero- and one-dimensional systems.
