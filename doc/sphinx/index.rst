Welcome

Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving
chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.

Cantera provides types (or classes) of objects representing phases of
matter, interfaces between these phases, reaction managers, time-dependent
reactor networks, and steady one-dimensional reacting flows. Cantera is
currently used for applications including combustion, detonations,
electrochemical energy conversion and storage, fuel cells, batteries, aqueous
electrolyte solutions, plasmas, and thin film deposition.

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written
in C++ and Fortran 90.
