Chemical Equilibrium Example Program
************************************

In the program below, the `equilibrate` method is called to set the gas to a
state of chemical equilibrium, holding the temperature and pressure fixed.

.. literalinclude:: demoequil.cpp
   :language: c++

The program output is::

How can we tell that this is really a state of chemical equilibrium? Well, by
applying the equation of reaction equilibrium to formation reactions from the
elements, it is straightforward to show that:

.. math:: \mu_k = \sum_m \lambda_m a_{km}.

where :math:`\mu_k` is the chemical potential of species *k*, :math:`a_{km}` is
the number of atoms of element *m* in species *k*, and :math:`\lambda_m` is the
chemical potential of the elemental species per atom (the so-called "element
potential"). In other words, the chemical potential of each species in an
equilibrium state is a linear sum of contributions from each atom. We see that
this is true in the output above---the chemical potential of H2 is exactly
twice that of H, the chemical potential for OH is the sum of the values for H
and O, the value for H2O2 is twice as large as the value for OH, and so on.

We'll see later how the :ct:`equilibrate <Cantera::ThermoPhase::equilibrate>`
function really works.
