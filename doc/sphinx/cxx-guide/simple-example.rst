A Very Simple C++ Program
*************************

A short C++ program that uses Cantera is shown below. This program reads in a
specification of a gas mixture from an input file, and then builds a new object
representing the mixture. It then sets the thermodynamic state and composition
of the gas mixture, and prints out a summary of its properties.

.. literalinclude:: demo1a.cpp
   :language: c++

This program produces the output below::

          temperature             500  K
             pressure          202650  Pa

As C++ programs go, this one is *very* short. It is the Cantera equivalent of
the "Hello, World" program most programming textbooks begin with. But it
illustrates some important points in writing Cantera C++ programs.

Catching :ct:`CanteraError` exceptions
======================================

The entire body of the program is put inside a function that is invoked within
a ``try`` block in the main program. In this way, exceptions thrown in the
function or in any procedure it calls may be caught. In this program, a
``catch`` block is defined for exceptions of type :ct:`CanteraError`. Cantera
throws exceptions of this type, so it is always a good idea to catch them.

The ``report`` function
=======================

The :ct:`report` function generates a nicely-formatted report of the properties of
a phase, including its composition in both mole (X) and mass (Y) units. For
each species present, the non-dimensional chemical potential is also printed.
This is handy particularly when doing equilibrium calculations. This function
is very useful to see at a glance the state of some phase.
