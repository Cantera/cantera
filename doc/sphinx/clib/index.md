# CLib Interface Documentation

```{caution}
The CLib API is an experimental part of Cantera and may be changed without notice.
```

Cantera has two CLib interfaces:

- `clib`: The _traditional_ CLib is hand-coded and is not feature-complete. It is
  installed by default.

- `clib_experimental`: The [](../develop/clib-extensions) is currently in preview and
  will replace the _traditional_ CLib starting in Cantera 3.2.
  To install, follow steps outlined in the
  [development reference](sec-sourcegen-clib-install).

```{note}
A roadmap of the CLib transition is outlined in GitHub issue
[Cantera/enhancements#220](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/220).
