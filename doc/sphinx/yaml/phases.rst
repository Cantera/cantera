*****************
Phase Definitions
*****************

A ``phase`` is a mapping that contains definitions for the elements, species,
and optionally reactions that can take place in that phase. The fields of a
``phase`` entry are:

``name``
    String identifier used for the phase. Required.

``elements``
    Specification for the elements present in the phase. This can be:

    - Omitted, in which case the standard elements will be added as needed by
      the species included in the phase.
    - A list of element symbols, which can be either defined in the ``elements``
      section of the file or taken from the standard elements.
    - A list of single-key mappings of section names to lists of element
      symbols. These sections can be in the same file as the phase definition,
      or from another file if written as ``file-path/sectionname``. If a
      relative path is specified, the directory containing the current file is
      searched first, followed by the Cantera data path. Standard elements can
      be included by referencing the fictitious section ``default``.

``species``
    Specification for the species present in the phase. This can be:

    - a list of species that appear in the ``species`` section of the file.
    - The string ``all``, to indicate that all species in the ``species``
      section should be included. This is the default if no ``species`` entry
      is present.
    - A list of single-key mappings of section names to either the string
      ``all`` or a list of species names. These sections can be in the same
      file as the phase definition, or from another file if written as
      ``file-path/sectionname``. If a relative path is specified, the directory
      containing the current file is searched first, followed by the Cantera
      data path.

    Species may be skipped depending on the setting of the
    ``skip-undeclared-elements`` option.

``skip-undeclared-elements``
    If set to ``true``, do not add species that contain elements that are not
    explicitly included in the phase. The default is ``false``, where the
    presence of such species is considered an error.

``skip-undeclared-third-bodies``
   If set to ``true``, ignore third body efficiencies for species that are not
   defined in the phase. The default is ``false``, where the presence of
   such third body specifications is considered an error.

``state``
    A mapping specifying the thermodynamic state. See
    :ref:`sec-yaml-setting-state`.

``thermo``
    String specifying the phase thermodynamic model to be used. Supported model
    strings are:

``reactions``
    Source of reactions to include in the phase, if a kinetics model has been
    specified. This can be:

    - The string ``all``, which indicates that all reactions from the
      ``reactions`` section of the file should be included. This is the default
      if no ``reactions`` entry is present.

      should be included.

      the phase is constructed.
    - A list of sections from which to include reactions. These sections can be
      in the same file as the phase definition, or from another file if written
      as ``file-path/sectionname``. If a relative path is specified, the
      directory containing the current file is searched first, followed by the
      Cantera data path.
    - A list of single-key mappings of section names to rules for adding
      reactions, where for each section name, that rule is either ``all`` or

.. _sec-yaml-setting-state:

Setting the state
=================

The state of a ``phase`` can be set using two properties to set the
thermodynamic state, plus the composition.

The composition can be set using one of the following fields, depending on the
phase type. The composition is specified as a mapping of species names to
values. Where necessary, the values will be automatically normalized.

- ``mass-fractions`` or ``Y``
- ``mole-fractions`` or ``X``
- ``coverages``
- ``molalities`` or ``M``

The thermodynamic state can be set using the following property pairs, with some
exceptions for phases where setting that property pair is not implemented. All
properties are on a per unit mass basis where relevant:

- ``T`` and ``P``
- ``T`` and ``D``
- ``T`` and ``V``
- ``H`` and ``P``
- ``U`` and ``V``
- ``S`` and ``V``
- ``S`` and ``P``

- ``P`` and ``V``
- ``U`` and ``P``
- ``V`` and ``H``
