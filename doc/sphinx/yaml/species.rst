The fields of a ``species`` entry are:

    and parameters. See :ref:`sec-yaml-species-thermo`.

    Mapping containing the equation of state model specification for the
    species, any parameters for that model, and any parameters for interactions
    with other species. :ref:`sec-yaml-species-eos`. If this field is absent,
    the ``ideal-gas`` model is assumed.

    parameters. See :ref:`sec-yaml-species-transport`.
