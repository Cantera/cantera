Reactors and Reactor Networks
*****************************

A Cantera Reactor represents the simplest form of a chemically reacting system.
It corresponds to an extensive thermodynamic control volume `V`, in which all
state variables are homogeneously distributed. The system is generally unsteady,
i.e. all states are functions of time. In particular, transient state changes
due to chemical reactions are possible. However, thermodynamic (but not
chemical) equilibrium is assumed to be present throughout the reactor at all
instants of time.

Reactors can interact with the surrounding environment in multiple ways:

- Expansion/compression work: By moving the walls of the reactor, its volume can
  be changed and expansion or compression work can be done by or on the system,
  i.e., the Reactor.
- Heat transfer: An arbitrary heat transfer rate can be defined to cross the
  boundaries of the reactor.
- Mass transfer: The reactor can have multiple inlets and outlets. For the
  inlets, arbitrary states can be defined. Through the outlets, fluid with the
  current state of the reactor exits the reactor.
- Surface interaction: One or multiple walls can influence the chemical
  reactions in the reactor. This is not just restricted to catalytic reactions,
  but mass transfer between the surface and the fluid can also be modeled.

All of these interactions do not have to be constant, but can vary as a function
of time or state. For example, heat transfer can be described as a function of
the temperature difference between the reactor and the environment, or the wall
movement can be modeled depending on the pressure difference. Typically,
interactions of the reactor with the environment are defined on one or multiple
*walls*, *inlets*, and *outlets*.

In addition to single reactors, Cantera is also able to interconnect reactors
into a *Reactor Network*. Each reactor in a network may be connected so that
the contents of one reactor flow into another. Reactors may also be in contact
with one another or the environment via walls which move or conduct heat.

Governing Equations for Single Reactors
=======================================

The state variables for Cantera's general reactor model are

- `m`, the mass of the reactor's contents (in kg)
- `V`, the reactor volume (in m\ :sup:`3`) (not a state variable for
  *Constant Pressure Reactor* and *Ideal Gas Constant Pressure Reactor*)
- A state variable describing the energy of the system, depending on the
  configuration (see `Energy Conservation`_ for further explanation):

  - General *Reactor*: `U`, the total internal energy of the reactors
    contents (in J)
  - *Constant Pressure Reactor*: `H`, the total enthalpy of the reactors
    contents (in J)
  - *Ideal Gas Reactor* and *Ideal Gas Constant Pressure Reactor*: `T`, the
    temperature (in K)

- `Y_k`, the mass fractions for each species (dimensionless)

Mass Conservation
-----------------

The total mass of the reactor's contents changes as a result of flow through
the reactor's inlets and outlets, and production of homogeneous phase species
on the reactor walls:

.. math::

    \frac{dm}{dt} = \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} - \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out} +
                    \dot{m}_{wall}

Species Conservation
--------------------

The rate at which species `k` is generated through homogeneous phase reactions
is `V \dot{\omega}_k W_k`, and the total rate at which species `k` is generated
is:

.. math::

    \dot{m}_{k,gen} = V \dot{\omega}_k W_k + \dot{m}_{k,wall}

The rate of change in the mass of each species is:

.. math::

    \frac{d(mY_k)}{dt} = \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} Y_{k,in} -
                         \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out} Y_k +
                         \dot{m}_{k,gen}

Expanding the derivative on the left hand side and substituting the equation
for `dm/dt`, the equation for each homogeneous phase species is:

.. math::

    m \frac{dY_k}{dt} = \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} (Y_{k,in} - Y_k)+
                      \dot{m}_{k,gen} - Y_k \dot{m}_{wall}


Reactor Volume
--------------

The reactor volume changes as a function of time due to the motion of one or
more walls:

.. math::

    \frac{dV}{dt} = \sum_w f_w A_w v_w(t)

where `f_w = \pm 1` indicates the facing of the wall, `A_w` is the surface
area of the wall, and `v_w(t)` is the velocity of the wall as a function of
time.

For *Constant Pressure Reactor* and *Ideal Gas Constant Pressure Reactor*, the
volume is not a state variable, but instead takes on whatever value is
consistent with holding the pressure constant.

Energy Conservation
-------------------

The solution of the energy equation can be enabled or disabled by changing the
``energy_enabled`` flag. It is enabled by default.

The implemented formulation of the energy equation depends on which reactor
model is used.

Standard Reactor
****************

The equation for the total internal energy is found by writing the first law
for an open system:

.. math::

    \frac{dU}{dt} = - p \frac{dV}{dt} - \dot{Q} +
                    \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} h_{in} - h \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out}


Constant Pressure Reactor
*************************

For this reactor model, the pressure is held constant. The volume is not a
state variable, but instead takes on whatever value is consistent with holding
the pressure constant. The total enthalpy replaces the total internal energy
as a state variable. Using the definition of the total enthalpy:

.. math::

    H = U + pV

    \frac{d H}{d t} = \frac{d U}{d t} + p \frac{dV}{dt} + V \frac{dp}{dt}

Noting that `dp/dt = 0` and substituting into the energy equation yields:

.. math::

   \frac{dH}{dt} = - \dot{Q} + \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} h_{in}
                   - h \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out}


Ideal Gas Reactor
*****************

In case of the Ideal Gas Reactor Model, the reactor temperature `T` is used
instead of the total internal energy `U` as a state variable. For an ideal gas,
we can rewrite the total internal energy in terms of the mass fractions and
temperature:

.. math::

    U = m \sum_k Y_k u_k(T)

    \frac{dU}{dt} = u \frac{dm}{dt}
                    + m c_v \frac{dT}{dt}
                    + m \sum_k u_k \frac{dY_k}{dt}

Substituting the corresponding derivatives yields an equation for the
temperature:

.. math::

    m c_v \frac{dT}{dt} = - p \frac{dV}{dt} - \dot{Q}
        + \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} \left( h_{in} - \sum_k u_k Y_{k,in} \right)
        - \frac{p V}{m} \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out} - \sum_k \dot{m}_{k,gen} u_k

While this form of the energy equation is somewhat more complicated, it
significantly reduces the cost of evaluating the system Jacobian, since the
derivatives of the species equations are taken at constant temperature instead
of constant internal energy.


Ideal Gas Constant Pressure Reactor
***********************************

As for the Ideal Gas Reactors, we replace the total enthalpy as a state
variable with the temperature by writing the total enthalpy in terms of the
mass fractions and temperature:

.. math::

    H = m \sum_k Y_k h_k(T)

    \frac{dH}{dt} = h \frac{dm}{dt} + m c_p \frac{dT}{dt}
                    + m \sum_k h_k \frac{dY_k}{dt}

Substituting the corresponding derivatives yields an equation for the
temperature:

.. math::

    m c_p \frac{dT}{dt} = - \dot{Q} - \sum_k h_k \dot{m}_{k,gen}
        + \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} \left(h_{in} - \sum_k h_k Y_{k,in} \right)


Wall Interactions
-----------------

The total rate of heat transfer through all walls is:

.. math::

    \dot{Q} = \sum_w f_w \dot{Q}_w

where `f_w = \pm 1` indicates the facing of the wall (+1 for the reactor on the
left, -1 for the reactor on the right). The heat flux `\dot{Q}_w` through a wall
`k` connecting reactors "left" and "right" is computed as:

.. math::

    \dot{Q}_w = U A (T_{\rm left} - T_{\rm right})
              + \epsilon\sigma A (T_{\rm left}^4 - T_{\rm right}^4)
              + A q_0(t)

where `U` is a user-specified heat transfer coefficient (W/m^2-K), `A` is the
wall area (m^2), `\epsilon` is the user-specified emissivity, `\sigma` is the
Stefan-Boltzmann radiation constant, and `q_0(t)` is a user-specified,
time-dependent heat flux (W/m^2). This definition is such that positive `q_0(t)`
implies heat transfer from the "left" reactor to the "right" reactor. Each of
the user-specified terms defaults to 0.

In case of surface reactions, there is a net generation (or
destruction) of homogeneous phase species at the wall. The molar rate of
production for each species `k` on wall `w` is `\dot{s}_{k,w}` (in kmol/s/m\
:sup:`2`). The total (mass) production rate for species `k` on all walls is:

.. math::

    \dot{m}_{k,wall} = W_k \sum_w A_w \dot{s}_{k,w}

where `W_k` is the molecular weight of species `k` and `A_w` is the area of
each wall. The net mass flux from all walls is then:

.. math::

    \dot{m}_{wall} = \sum_k \dot{m}_{k,wall}


Reactor Networks and Devices
============================

While reactors by themselves just define the above governing equations of the
reactor, the time integration is performed in reactor networks. A reactor
network is therefore necessary even if only a single reactor is considered.

The advantage of reactor networks obviously is that multiple reactors can be
interconnected. Not only mass flow from one reactor into another can be
realized, but also heat can be transferred, or the wall between reactors can
move. To set up a network, the following components can be defined in addition
to the reactors previously mentioned:

- **Reservoir**: A reservoir can be thought of as an infinitely large volume, in
  which all states are predefined and never change from their initial values.
  Typically, it represents a vessel to define temperature and composition of a
  stream of mass flowing into a reactor, or the ambient fluid surrounding the
  reactor network. Besides, the fluid flow finally finally exiting a reactor
  network has to flow into a reservoir. In the latter case, the state of the
  reservoir (except pressure) is irrelevant.

- **Wall**: A wall separates two reactors, or a reactor and a reservoir. A wall
  has a finite area, may conduct or radiate heat between the two reactors on
  either side, and may move like a piston.

  Walls are stateless objects in Cantera, meaning that no differential equation
  is integrated to determine any wall property. Since it is the wall (piston)
  velocity that enters the energy equation, this means that it is the velocity,
  not the acceleration or displacement, that is specified. The wall velocity is
  computed from

  .. math:: v = K(P_{\rm left} - P_{\rm right}) + v_0(t),

  where :math:`K` is a non-negative constant, and :math:`v_0(t)` is a specified
  function of time. The velocity is positive if the wall is moving to the right.

  The heat flux through the wall is computed from

  .. math:: q = U(T_{\rm left} - T_{\rm right}) + \epsilon\sigma (T_{\rm left}^4
                - T_{\rm right}^4) + q_0(t),

  where :math:`U` is the overall heat transfer coefficient for
  conduction/convection, and :math:`\epsilon` is the emissivity. The function
  :math:`q_0(t)` is a specified function of time. The heat flux is positive when
  heat flows from the reactor on the left to the reactor on the right.

  A heterogeneous reaction mechanism may be specified for one or both of the
  wall surfaces. The mechanism object (typically an instance of class Interface)
  must be constructed so that it is properly linked to the object representing
  the fluid in the reactor the surface in question faces. The surface
  temperature on each side is taken to be equal to the temperature of the
  reactor it faces.

  Source: `Python <cython/zerodim.html#wall>`_ | :ct:`C++ <Wall>`

- **Valve**: A valve is a flow devices with mass flow rate that is a function of
  the pressure drop across it. The default behavior is linear:

  .. math:: \dot m = K_v (P_1 - P_2)

  if :math:`P_1 > P_2.` Otherwise, :math:`\dot m = 0`. However, an arbitrary
  function can also be specified, such that

  .. math:: \dot m = F(P_1 - P_2)

  if :math:`P_1 > P_2`, or :math:`\dot m = 0` otherwise. It is never possible
  for the flow to reverse and go from the downstream to the upstream
  reactor/reservoir through a line containing a Valve object.

  Valve objects are often used between an upstream reactor and a downstream
  reactor or reservoir to maintain them both at nearly the same pressure. By
  setting the constant :math:`K_v` to a sufficiently large value, very small
  pressure differences will result in flow between the reactors that counteracts
  the pressure difference.

- **Mass Flow Controller**: A mass flow controller maintains a specified mass
  flow rate independent of upstream and downstream conditions. The equation used
  to compute the mass flow rate is

  .. math:: \dot m = \max(\dot m_0, 0.0)

  where :math:`\dot m_0` is either a constant value or a function of time. Note
  that if :math:`\dot m_0 < 0`, the mass flow rate will be set to zero, since
  reversal of the flow direction is not allowed.

  Unlike a real mass flow controller, a MassFlowController object will maintain
  the flow even if the downstream pressure is greater than the upstream
  pressure. This allows simple implementation of loops, in which exhaust gas
  from a reactor is fed back into it through an inlet. But note that this
  capability should be used with caution, since no account is taken of the work
  required to do this.

- **Pressure Controller**: A pressure controller is designed to be used in
  conjunction with another 'master' flow controller, typically a
  MassFlowController. The master flow controller is installed on the inlet of
  the reactor, and the corresponding PressureController is installed on on
  outlet of the reactor. The PressureController mass flow rate is equal to the
  master mass flow rate, plus a small correction dependent on the pressure
  difference:

  .. math:: \dot m = \dot m_{\rm master} + K_v(P_1 - P_2).

Time Integration
----------------

Cantera provides an ODE solver for solving the stiff equations of reacting
systems. If installed in combination with SUNDIALS, their optimized solver is
used. Starting off the current state of the system, it can be advanced in time
by one of the following methods:

- ``step()``: The step method computes the state of the system at the a priori
  unspecified time `t_{\rm new}`. The time `t_{\rm new}` is internally computed
  so that all states of the system only change within a (specifiable) band of
  absolute and relative tolerances. Additionally, the time step must not be
  larger than a predefined maximum time step `\Delta t_{\rm max}`. The new time
  `t_{\rm new}` is returned by this function.

- ``advance``\ `(t_{\rm new})`: This method computes the state of the system at
  time `t_{\rm new}`. `t_{\rm new}` describes the absolute time from the initial
  time of the system. By calling this method in a for loop for pre-defined
  times, the state of the system is obtained for exactly the times specified.
  Internally, several ``step()`` calls are typically performed to reach the
  accurate state at time `t_{\rm new}`.

- ``advance_to_steady_state(max_steps, residual_threshold, atol,
  write_residuals)`` [Python interface only]: If the steady state solution of a
  reactor network is of interest, this method can be used. Internally, the
  steady state is approached by time stepping. The network is considered to be
  at steady state if the feature-scaled residual of the state vector is below a
  given threshold value (which by default is 10 times the time step rtol).

The use of the ``advance`` method in a loop has the advantage that it produces
results corresponding to a predefined time series. These are associated with a
predefined memory consumption and well comparable between simulation runs with
different parameters. However, some detail (e.g. a fast ignition process) might
not be resolved in the output data due to the typically large time steps.

The ``step`` method results in much more data points because of the small
timesteps needed. Additionally, the absolute time has to be kept tracked of
manually.

Even though Cantera comes pre-defined with typical parameters for tolerances
and the maximum internal time step, the solution sometimes diverges. To solve
this problem, three parameters can be tuned: The absolute time stepping
tolerances, the relative time stepping tolerances, and the maximum time step. A
reduction of the latter value is particularly useful when dealing with abrupt
changes in the boundary conditions (e.g. opening/closing valves, see also
example :ref:`py-example-ic_engine.py`).

General Usage in Cantera
========================

In Cantera, the following steps are typically necessary to investigate a
reactor network:

1. Define ``Solution`` objects for the fluids to be flowing through your
reactor network.

2. Define the reactor type(s) and reservoir(s) that describe your system. Chose
Ideal Gas (Constant Pressure) Reactor(s) if you only consider ideal gas phases.

3. *Optional:* Set up the boundary conditions and flow devices between reactors
or reservoirs.

4. Define a reactor network which contains all the reactors previously created.

5. Advance the simulation in time, typically in a for- or while-loop. Note that
only the current state is stored in Cantera by default. If you want to observe
the transient states, you manually have to keep track of them.

6. Analyze the data.

Note that Cantera always solves a transient problem. If you are interested in
steady-state conditions, you can run your simulation for a long time until the
states are converged (see e.g. example :ref:`py-example-surf_pfr.py`,
:ref:`py-example-combustor.py`).

Cantera comes with a broad variety of well-commented example scrips for reactor
networks. Please refer to them for further information (:ref:`Python <sec-cython-examples>`, :ref:`Matlab <sec-matlab-examples>`).

Common Reactor Types and their Implementation in Cantera
========================================================

Batch Reactor at Constant Volume or at Constant Pressure
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are interested in how a homogeneous chemical composition changes in time
when it is left to its own, a simple batch reactor can be used. Two versions
are commonly considered: A rigid vessel with fixed volume but variable
pressure, or a system idealized at constant pressure but varying volume.

In Cantera, such a simulation can be performed very easily. The initial state
of the solution can be specified by composition and a set of thermodynamic
parameters (like temperature and pressure) as a standard Cantera solution
object. Upon its base, a general (Ideal Gas) Reactor or an (Ideal Gas) Constant
Pressure Reactor can be created, depending on if a constant volume or constant
pressure batch reactor should be considered, respectively. The behavior of the
solution in time can be simulated as a very simple Reactor Network containing
only the formerly created reactor.

An example for such a Batch Reactor is :ref:`py-example-reactor1.py`.

Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor
---------------------------------

A Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), also often referred to as
Well-Stirred Reactor (WSR), Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR), or Longwell
Reactor, is essentially a single Cantera reactor with an inlet, an outlet, and
constant volume. Therefore, the `Governing Equations for Single Reactors`_
defined above apply accordingly.

Steady state solutions to CSTRs are often of interest. In this case, the mass
flow rate `\dot{m}` is constant and equal at inlet and outlet. The mass
contained in the confinement `m` divided by `\dot{m}` defines the mean
residence time of the fluid in the confinement.

At steady state, the time derivatives in the governing equations become zero,
and the system of ordinary differential equations can be reduced to a set of
coupled nonlinear algebraic equations. A Newton solver could be used to solve
this system of equations. However, a sophisticated implementation might be
required to account for the strong nonlinearities and the presence of multiple
solutions.

Cantera does not have such a Newton solver implemented. Instead, steady CSTRs
are simulated by considering a time-dependent constant volume reactor with
specified in- and outflow conditions. Starting off at an initial solution, the
reactor network containing this reactor is advanced in time until the state of
the solution is converged. An example for this procedure is
:ref:`py-example-combustor.py`.

A problem can be the ignition of a CSTR: If the reactants are not reactive
enough, the simulation can result in the trivial solution that inflow and
outflow states are identical. To solve this problem, the reactor can be
initialized with a high temperature and/or radical concentration. A good
approach is to use the equilibrium composition of the reactants (which can be
computed using Cantera's ``equilibrate`` function) as an initial guess.


Plug-Flow Reactor
-----------------

A Plug-Flow Reactor (PFR) represents a steady-state channel with a
cross-sectional area `A`. Typically an ideal gas flows through it at a constant
mass flow rate `\dot{m}`. Perpendicular to the flow direction, the gas is
considered to be completely homogeneous. In the axial direction `z`, the states
of the gas is allowed to change. However, all diffusion processes are neglected.

Plug-Flow Reactors are often used to simulate ignition delay times, emission
formation, and catalytic processes.

The governing equations of Plug-Flow Reactors are [KCG2003]_:

- Mass conservation:

  .. math:: \frac{d(\rho u A)}{dz} =  P' \sum_k \dot{s}_k W_k

  where `u` is the axial velocity in (m/s) and `P'` is the chemically active
  channel perimeter in (m) (chemically active perimeter per unit length).

- Continuity equation of species `k`:

 .. math:: \rho u \frac{d Y_k}{dz} + Y_k P' \sum_k \dot{s}_k W_k =
      \dot{\omega}_k W_k + P' \dot{s}_k W_k

- Energy conservation:

  .. math:: \rho u A c_p \frac{d T}{d z} =
     - A \sum_k h_k \dot{\omega}_k W_k
     - P' \sum_k h_k \dot{s}_k W_k
     + U P (T_w - T)

  where `U` is the heat transfer coefficient in (W/m/K), `P` is the perimeter of
  the duct in (m), and `T_w` is the wall temperature in (K). Kinetic and
  potential energies are neglected.

- Momentum conservation in the axial direction:

  .. math:: \rho u A \frac{d u}{d z} + u P' \sum_k \dot{s}_k W_k =
     - \frac{d (p A)}{dz} - \tau_w P

  where `\tau_w` is the wall friction coefficient (which might be computed from
  Reynolds number based correlations).

Even though this problem extends geometrically in one direction, it can be
modeled via zero-dimensional reactors: Due to the neglecting of diffusion,
downstream parts of the reactor have no influence on upstream parts. Therefore,
PFRs can be modeled by marching from the beginning to the end of the reactor.

Cantera does not (yet) provide dedicated class to solve the PFR equations (The
``FlowReactor`` class is currently under development). However, there are two
ways to simulate a PFR with the reactor elements previously presented. Both
rely on the assumption that pressure is approximately constant throughout the
Plug-Flow Reactor and that there is no friction. The momentum conservation
equation is thus neglected.


PFR Modeling by Considering a Lagrangian Reactor
************************************************

A Plug-Flow Reactor can also be described from a Lagrangian point of view: An
unsteady fluid particle is considered which travels along the axial streamline
through the PFR. Since there is no information traveling upstream, the state
change of the fluid particle can be computed by a forward (upwind) integration
in time. Using the continuity equation, the speed of the particle can be
derived. By integrating the velocity in time, the temporal information can be
translated into the spatial resolution of the PFR.

An example for this procedure can be found in :ref:`py-example-pfr.py`.


PFR Modeling as a Series of CSTRs
*********************************

The Plug-Flow Reactor is spatially discretized into a large number of axially
distributed volumes. These volumes are modeled to be steady-state CSTRs.

The only reason to use this approach as opposed to the Lagrangian one is if you
need to include surface reactions, because the system of equations ends up
being a DAE system instead of an ODE system.

In Cantera, it is sufficient to consider a single reactor and march it forward
in time, because there is no information traveling upstream. The mass flow rate
`\dot{m}` through the PFR enters the reactor from an upstream reservoir. For
the first reactor, the reservoir conditions are the inflow boundary conditions
of the PFR. By performing a time integration as described in `Continuously
Stirred Tank Reactor`_ until the state of the reactor is converged, the
steady-state CSTR solution is computed. The state of the CSTR is the inlet
boundary condition for the next CSTR downstream.

An example for this procedure can be found in :ref:`py-example-pfr.py` and
:ref:`py-example-surf_pfr.py`.


Advanced Concepts
=================

In some cases, Cantera's solver is insufficient to describe a certain
configuration. In this situation, Cantera can still be used to provide chemical
and thermodynamic computations, but external ODE solvers can be applied. See
example :ref:`py-example-custom.py`.
