# MATLAB Toolbox Documentation

```{caution}
The MATLAB toolbox is an experimental part of Cantera and may be changed without notice.
```

The _experimental_ MATLAB toolbox for Cantera is currently in preview and replaces the
_legacy_ MATLAB toolbox that was discontinued after Cantera 3.0. The
replacement introduces modern MATLAB object-oriented programming structure and syntax,
while replacing a custom-compiled MEX interface with MATLAB's
[`clibgen`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/clibgen-package.html) to
automatically wrap functions exposed by [Cantera CLib](../clib/index).


```{note}
For current information on the state of the _experimental_ MATLAB toolbox, refer to
GitHub issues and enhancement requests, specifically:

- [**Open Pull Requests**](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pulls?q=is%3Apr+state%3Aopen+label%3Amatlab)

- [**Open Enhancements**](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Amatlab)

Installation instructions are provided in
[`interfaces/matlab_experimental/README.md`](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/main/interfaces/matlab_experimental/README.md)
within the Cantera source code.
