# MATLAB Toolbox Documentation

```{caution}
The MATLAB toolbox is an experimental part of Cantera and may be changed or removed
without notice.
```

The _experimental_ MATLAB toolbox for Cantera is currently in preview and replaces the
_legacy_ MATLAB toolbox that is discontinued and removed in Cantera 3.1. The
replacement introduces modern MATLAB object-oriented programming structure and syntax,
while replacing the compiled MEX interface with direct function calling from
[Cantera CLib](../clib/index).


```{note}
For current information on the state of the _experimental_ MATLAB toolbox, refer to
GitHub issue
[Cantera/enhancements#177](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/177) and
issues linked therein. Installation instructions are provided in
`interfaces/matlab_experimental/readme.md` within the Cantera source code.
