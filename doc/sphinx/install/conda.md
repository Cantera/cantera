# Installing with Conda

(sec-install-conda)=

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#Downloads) and
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) are Python
distributions that include the ``conda`` package manager, which can be used to install
Cantera.

Installing Cantera using Conda can provide the Cantera
[Python module](sec-conda-python-interface) and
[MATLAB toolbox](sec-conda-matlab-interface), as well as libraries for linking to
applications written in C++, C, or Fortran 90. There are some exceptions to the
availability of each interface depending on the operating system and Conda channel used.

Both the Anaconda and Miniconda distributions are available for Linux, macOS (Intel and
ARM/Apple Silicon), and Windows. On Windows, users should install a 64-bit version of
Anaconda or Miniconda, since the Cantera Conda packages are only available for 64-bit
installations.

Both Anaconda and Miniconda include the `conda` package manager; the difference is that
Anaconda includes a large number of Python packages that are widely used in scientific
applications, while Miniconda is a minimal distribution that only includes Python and
Conda, although all of the packages available in Anaconda can be installed in Miniconda.
For more details on how to use conda, see the
[conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html).

Conda can install a large set of packages by default and it is possible to install
packages such as Cantera that are maintained independently. These additional channels
from which packages may be obtained are specified by adding the `--channel` option in
the `install` or `create` commands.

For instructions on upgrading an existing conda-based installation of Cantera, see
[Upgrading from an earlier Cantera version](sec-conda-python-upgrade).

## Python interface

Cantera's Python interface is available from two channels:

1. The `cantera` channel. This channel should be used if you installed Python from the
   default channel in conda. This channel also has pre-release versions of Cantera for
   testing. Cantera packages are available in this channel for the following platforms:

   - Windows (64-bit Intel)
   - Linux (64-bit Intel)
   - macOS (64-bit Intel and 64-bit ARM (Apple Silicon))

2. The `conda-forge` channel. This channel should be used if you installed Python from
   the `conda-forge` channel or if your OS/processor combination is not supported by the
   `cantera` channel. Cantera packages are available in this channel for the following
   platforms:

   - Windows (64-bit Intel)
   - Linux (64-bit Intel, 64-bit ARM, and 64-bit PPCLE)
   - macOS (64-bit Intel and 64-bit ARM (Apple Silicon))

### Option 1: Create a new environment for Cantera

The following instructions will create a conda environment where you can use Cantera
from Python. For this example, the environment is named `ct-env`. From the command
line (or the Anaconda Prompt on Windows), run:

```shell
conda create --name ct-env --channel cantera cantera ipython matplotlib jupyter
```

This will create an environment named `ct-env` with Cantera, IPython, Matplotlib, and
all their dependencies installed. In this case, we want to install Cantera from the
`cantera` channel, so we add `--channel cantera` and to tell Conda to look at the
`cantera` channel in addition to the default channels.

If you want to use the `conda-forge` channel, replace `--channel cantera` with
`--channel conda-forge`.

To use the scripts and modules installed in the `ct-env` environment, including Jupyter,
you must activate it it by running:

```shell
conda activate ct-env
```

### Option 2: Create a new environment using an environment file

This option is similar to **Option 1** but includes a few other packages that you may
find helpful as you're working with Cantera. Copy and paste the contents of the file
shown below into a file called `environment.yaml`. Then, save the the file somewhere and
remember that location.

```yaml
name: ct-env
channels:
- cantera  # or use cantera/label/dev for alpha/beta packages
- defaults
dependencies:
- python  # Cantera supports Python 3.8 and up
- cantera
- ipython  # optional (needed for nicer interactive command line)
- jupyter  # optional (needed for Jupyter Notebook)
- matplotlib  # optional (needed for plots)
- python-graphviz  # optional (needed for reaction path diagrams)
- pandas  # optional (needed for pandas interface)
```

From the command line (or the Anaconda Prompt on Windows), change directory into the
folder where you saved `environment.yaml`:

```shell
cd folder/where/you/saved
```

and then run:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

This will create an environment called `ct-env`. Once you've done that, you need to
activate the environment before using any scripts or modules that you just installed:

```shell
conda activate ct-env
```

### Option 3: Install the development version of Cantera

To install a recent development snapshot (that is, an alpha or beta version) of Cantera,
use the `cantera/label/dev` channel. Assuming you have an environment named `ct-dev`,
you can type:

```shell
conda activate ct-dev
conda install --channel cantera/label/dev cantera
```

If you later want to revert back to the stable version in that environment, first remove
and then reinstall Cantera:

```shell
conda activate ct-dev
conda remove cantera
conda install --channel cantera cantera
```

Alternatively, you can remove the `ct-dev` environment and follow Options 1 or 2 above
to create a new environment.

## Upgrading from an earlier Cantera version

If you already have Cantera installed in a conda environment (named, for example,
`ct-dev`), you can upgrade it to the latest version available by running the commands:

```shell
conda activate ct-dev
conda update --channel cantera cantera
```

This assumes you are using Python from the default conda channel. If you installed
Python and Cantera from the `conda-forge` channel, you should specify the option
`--channel conda-forge`.

(sec-conda-matlab-interface)=

## MATLAB interface

Cantera's MATLAB interface can be installed from the `cantera` channel. In this example,
the command will create a new conda environment named `ct-env`. From the command line
(or the Anaconda Prompt on Windows), run:

```shell
conda create --name ct-env --channel cantera cantera cantera-matlab
```

This will create an environment named `ct-env` with Cantera's Python and MATLAB
interfaces. Even if you plan to use Cantera via MATLAB, the Python interface is required
to convert input files. In this case, Cantera must be installed from the `cantera`
channel, so we add `--channel cantera` and to tell Conda to look at the `cantera`
channel in addition to the default channels.

To install the a development version of Cantera, specify `cantera/label/dev` as the
channel.

### Upgrading from an earlier Cantera version

If you already have the Cantera MATLAB interface installed in a conda environment
(named, for example, `ct-env`), you can upgrade it to the latest version available by
running the commands:

```shell
conda activate ct-env
conda update --channel cantera cantera cantera-matlab
```

(sec-conda-development-interface)=

## Development (C++ & Fortran 90) Interface

The Cantera development interface provides header files and libraries needed to compile
your own C++, C, or Fortran applications that link to Cantera. It also provides several
sample programs and build scripts that you can adapt for your own applications.

In the following example, Cantera's development interface is installed from the
`cantera/label/dev` channel. From the command line (or the Anaconda Prompt on Windows),
create a new conda environment named `ct-dev` using:

```shell
conda create --name ct-dev --channel cantera/label/dev libcantera-devel
```

This will create an environment named `ct-dev` with Cantera's development interface. In
this case, the addition of `--channel cantera/label/dev` ensures that the package is
pulled from the most recent available Cantera version. Note that `label/dev` refers to
the experimental development *channel* of Cantera, and not the development *interface*.

C++ header and libraries are installed within the `ct-dev` environment folder, which
itself depends on the type of `conda` installation, and is abbreviated as
`path/to/conda/envs` below. Within the `ct-dev` folder, locations follow `conda`
recommendations for a given operating system.

### Linux and macOS Systems

Installation folders are:

```shell
library files               path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/lib
pkg-config                  path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/lib/pkgconfig
C++ headers                 path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/include
Fortran module files        path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/include/cantera
samples                     path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/share/cantera/samples
data files                  path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/share/cantera/data
```

In addition to `libcantera-devel`, installation of additional packages is recommended:

```shell
$ conda activate ct-dev
$ conda install cmake scons pkg-config
```

C++ programs can be compiled according to instructions outlined in the
[C++ Guide](/userguide/compiling-cxx). Sample folders for C, C++ and Fortran include
preconfigured instruction files to facilitate compilation using the build tools
`SCons` and `CMake`, for example:

```shell
$ cd /path/to/conda/envs/ct-dev/share/cantera/samples/cxx/demo
$ scons  # uses SConstruct; or
$ cmake . && cmake --build .  # uses CMakeLists.txt
```

In addition, individual C++ Cantera sample programs can also be compiled using the
`pkg-config` build system:

```shell
$ g++ demo.cpp -o demo $(pkg-config --cflags --libs cantera)
```

In all cases, the build process yields the executable `demo`, which is run as:

```shell
$ ./demo
```

### Windows Systems

Installation folders are:

```shell
library files               path\to\conda\envs\ct-dev\Library\lib
C++ headers                 path\to\conda\envs\ct-dev\Library\include
samples                     path\to\conda\envs\ct-dev\share\cantera\samples
data files                  path\to\conda\envs\ct-dev\share\cantera\data
```

C++ programs can be compiled according to instructions outlined in the
[C++ Guide](/userguide/compiling-cxx). Sample folders for C and C++ programs include
preconfigured instruction files to facilitate compilation using the build tools `SCons`
and `CMake`, for example:

```shell
$ cd path\to\conda\envs\ct-dev\share\cantera\samples\cxx\demo
$ scons  # uses SConstruct; or
$ cmake . && cmake --build . --config Release  # uses CMakeLists.txt
```

Fortran 90 support is not provided for Windows.

### Upgrading from an earlier Cantera version

If you already have the Cantera development interface installed in a conda environment
(named, for example, `ct-dev`), you can upgrade it to the latest version available by
running the commands:

```shell
conda activate ct-dev
conda update --channel cantera/label/dev libcantera-devel
```
