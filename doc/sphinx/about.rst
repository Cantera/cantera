About Cantera
*************

Cantera is an open source scientific computing project, that allows users to
quickly and efficiently incorporate and execute fundamental thermodynamic,
chemical kinetic, and species transport calculations in their work. This can be
achieved by standalone command-line calls to core Cantera functions,
incorporating these calls into bespoke code or software, or by using any of the
solvers or examples distributed with the Cantera software package.

Cantera was originally started by Prof. David G. Goodwin at the California
Institute of Technology. Building on Prof. Goodwin's legacy, Cantera is licensed
under a permissive 3-Clause BSD license, ensuring that the software will remain
available for all to use.

Cantera is developed openly on GitHub. Contributions are welcomed from anyone in
the community; please see the `Contributors guide
<https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for
assistance in getting started.
