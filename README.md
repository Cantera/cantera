# What is Cantera?

Cantera is an open-source collection of object-oriented software tools
for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport
processes. Among other things, it can be used to:

-   Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
-   Compute chemical equilibrium
-   Evaluate species chemical production rates
-   Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
-   Simulate one-dimensional flames
-   Conduct reaction path analysis
-   Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
-   Model non-ideal fluids

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written
in C++ and Fortran 90. A number of
[examples of Cantera’s capabilities](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter)
are available in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These examples can be tried
interactively, in the cloud by using the following MyBinder link:
